5.0,The game is afoot!,"Frogwares' seventh installment of Sherlock Holmes is absolutely stunning. With incredibly lifelike modeling and rendering (you can practically count the pores on characters faces), a wide range of immersive environments with real-time effects (blowing leaves, running water, etc.), and plenty of intrigue to keep both Holmes and Watson busy, the game most certainly is afoot.<br /><br />Crimes and Punishments is not a linear story; rather, it is made up of six separate games loosely connected by the appearance of the Merry Men, a gang of terrorists. Several of the stories are taken from canon (Black Peter, Abbey Grange).<br /><br />As you play through the first case, on-screen guidance explains the gameplay basics. As Sherlock, you have several tools at your disposal, including a research library of encyclopedias and newspapers, a laboratory where you will be required to perform different types of chemical analyses, and Toby, the best nose in the British empire. You also have a full wardrobe of potential disguises including a makeup table; this will be of importance at several points in the game. At certain points, you have the chance to switch between Sherlock and Watson, a constable, and Toby, the “best nose in the British Empire.”<br /><br />There are several new features here from previous installments of Frogwares’ series, including Sherlock's mind palace, where you visually connect glowing synapses as new clues are unearthed, leading you to a series of possible conclusions as to the culprit(s). Depending on the conclusions you reach, various suspects will be pronounced guilty. Sherlock then has the additional responsibility of deciding whether to arrest or absolve each killer. Another feature is Sherlock's in-depth analysis of characters; you have the ability to slowly pan over each suspect, and Sherlock points out various facts that will enable you to unlock key plot points based on these observations. Sherlock also has two additional tools in his arsenal; one allowed you to observe details that others would miss (this is accomplished through a filter than also distorts background sounds), and the other allows you to mentally recreate an object (this is a mini puzzle in itself as each “mental object” requires manipulation to function).<br /><br />The locations range from grimy London alleys to Roman ruins, elaborate Chinese temples, and stately manors. Each felt totally unique and distinct from the others; in fact I was floored by the attention to detail and number of explorable areas as other detective games I have played give a much smaller venue.  In addition to puzzles (which range from frequently easy to very difficult), there are a series of mini-games that involve boxing, archery, chemical analysis, recreating objects, and a whole lot of lockpicking. These mini games can be skipped, which will drastically shorten the length of the game. It’s also obvious that the mini games were designed with console gaming in mind, as accomplishing some of them on a computer keyboard (without a joypad) is pretty much impossible, but I was able to accomplish most of them successfully.<br /><br />I found the length of the cases to be a bit uneven; for example, the first, second, and fourth cases felt shorter in comparison to the other three. I also felt the second case was the weakest of the six as the locations all felt extremely repetitive and I had deduced the basic plot very early into my investigation. The disguise feature is a great idea, but it seems to only have an effect at a couple of points in the game; it would have been interesting to see how suspects and NPCs reacted to Sherlock depending on his outfit at a given time. I would have also liked to see greater weight placed on the morality system; you are notified if you made the correct deduction, then told what percentage of fellow Steam gamers made the same judgment call. Once you make a final decision, the game erases all save points for that case, so if you want to see various endings, be sure to do so BEFORE accepting the final decision.<br /><br />There are also a number of awards that can be earned for accomplishing various cases, conversations, and minigames, which adds to the replay value.<br /><br />Voice acting was generally excellent, with dialogue that felt true to the characters and the period. The banter between Sherlock and Watson (and Sherlock's jibes at Lestrade and his brother Mycroft) felt true to the original stories. Even Mrs. Hudson makes an appearance, as do the Baker Street Irregulars and Bill Wiggins, who play a key role in several of the cases.<br /><br />Fans of BBC Sherlock, the original Conan Doyle stories, and detective novels in general (especially if you are a fan of the older Agatha Christie PC games as I am) will find much to recommend Sherlock; the graphics are simply stunning, the environments are totally immersive, and the replay value is high as there are so many potential outcomes, optional clues, minigames, and awards to earn.

4.0,"Dear sweet Charlotte, please come back....","I've played nearly all of the 28 Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive; my favorites of all time were [[ASIN:B000V728P2 Nancy Drew: The Legend of the Crystal Skull]](due to the great creepy voodoo vibe and goth prince Harry), [[ASIN:B0018XU9SQ Nancy Drew: The Phantom of Venice]] and [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]]. I loved the combination of culture, history, and mystery in these games.<br /><br />In Ghost of Thornton Hall, Nancy is called upon to find Jessalyn Thornton, a missing bride-to-be on Blackrock Island, ancestral home of the Thornton family. Thornton Hall is a dilapidated antebellum mansion flanked by skeletal moss-draped trees and a crypt / graveyard. Like CRY, you'll spend the entire game at night, which means lots of dark lighting (and ambiance). As other reviewers have pointed out, GTH felt a bit like a mashup of [[ASIN:B003BHGWMY Nancy Drew - Haunting of Castle Malloy]] and Legend of the Crystal Skull (missing bride-to-be + lots of time spent in graveyards / crypts).<br /><br />You'll spend much of the game untangling two separate mysteries: piecing together the puzzle of the missing bride-to-be as well as the death of Charlotte Thornton, whose ghost is said to haunt Blackrock Island. Nancy has the chance to interrogate several members of the Thornton family, although I would have liked to see more actual snooping (there's definitely much less snooping than in earlier games...and where do these people sleep / eat since no one apparently has a room at the house?).<br /><br />You're limited to three main locations; I would have liked a couple of extra rooms to explore within Thornton Hall (one humorous random ND moment: there's a tea set where you can make yourself unlimited tea, and then I realized that this was one of the few games without a bathroom!). A few more hotspots would have been nice, too (Jessalyn's purse is on the floor, but you can't explore it. Wait, shouldn't there be some evidence in there??). However, there are lots of animations and unexpected surprises that add some life to the creepy old mansion.<br /><br />SAW and CRY are definitely two of the spookier games in the series, but GTH has a sustained spookiness that pounces when you least expect it. Creepy events happen in every room at any moment, and combined with the eerie music (which has a great vocal / cello soundtrack), keep you on the edge of your seat. For me, the biggest cop-out was the supposed explanation for these at the end of the game...which wouldn't have explained all the sightings anyway. The game was morbid more than scary; there are several surprisingly dark subplots and possible endings for an ND game, and several of the conversations involve some pretty black humor on the part of one character in particular.<br /><br />The puzzles offered sufficient variety, but I would have liked to see more use made of the ghost hunting equipment that Savannah Woodham left for Nancy; it's pretty obvious that the hauntings are off the charts, but you only use it for one puzzle and then you're done (SAW was great about using EVP recorders and the like to try and capture evidence).<br /><br />If you're stuck, you can use the hint feature if you're playing as an Amateur Sleuth. Another cool touch is that there are three possible endings depending on how you play out the final scenario. It was fun playing through all three to see the different endings, which also added replay value.

I've played nearly all of the 28 Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive; my favorites of all time were [[ASIN:B000V728P2 Nancy Drew: The Legend of the Crystal Skull]](due to the great creepy voodoo vibe and goth prince Harry), [[ASIN:B0018XU9SQ Nancy Drew: The Phantom of Venice]] and [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]]. I loved the combination of culture, history, and mystery in these games.<br /><br />In Ghost of Thornton Hall, Nancy is called upon to find Jessalyn Thornton, a missing bride-to-be on Blackrock Island, ancestral home of the Thornton family. Thornton Hall is a dilapidated antebellum mansion flanked by skeletal moss-draped trees and a crypt / graveyard. Like CRY, you'll spend the entire game at night, which means lots of dark lighting (and ambiance). As other reviewers have pointed out, GTH felt a bit like a mashup of [[ASIN:B003BHGWMY Nancy Drew - Haunting of Castle Malloy]] and Legend of the Crystal Skull (missing bride-to-be + lots of time spent in graveyards / crypts).<br /><br />You'll spend much of the game untangling two separate mysteries: piecing together the puzzle of the missing bride-to-be as well as the death of Charlotte Thornton, whose ghost is said to haunt Blackrock Island. Nancy has the chance to interrogate several members of the Thornton family, although I would have liked to see more actual snooping (there's definitely much less snooping than in earlier games...and where do these people sleep / eat since no one apparently has a room at the house?).<br /><br />You're limited to three main locations; I would have liked a couple of extra rooms to explore within Thornton Hall (one humorous random ND moment: there's a tea set where you can make yourself unlimited tea, and then I realized that this was one of the few games without a bathroom!). A few more hotspots would have been nice, too (Jessalyn's purse is on the floor, but you can't explore it. Wait, shouldn't there be some evidence in there??). However, there are lots of animations and unexpected surprises that add some life to the creepy old mansion.<br /><br />SAW and CRY are definitely two of the spookier games in the series, but GTH has a sustained spookiness that pounces when you least expect it. Creepy events happen in every room at any moment, and combined with the eerie music (which has a great vocal / cello soundtrack), keep you on the edge of your seat. For me, the biggest cop-out was the supposed explanation for these at the end of the game...which wouldn't have explained all the sightings anyway. The game was morbid more than scary; there are several surprisingly dark subplots and possible endings for an ND game, and several of the conversations involve some pretty black humor on the part of one character in particular.<br /><br />The puzzles offered sufficient variety, but I would have liked to see more use made of the ghost hunting equipment that Savannah Woodham left for Nancy; it's pretty obvious that the hauntings are off the charts, but you only use it for one puzzle and then you're done (SAW was great about using EVP recorders and the like to try and capture evidence).<br /><br />If you're stuck, you can use the hint feature if you're playing as an Amateur Sleuth. Another cool touch is that there are three possible endings depending on how you play out the final scenario. It was fun playing through all three to see the different endings, which also added replay value. One feature that I liked was that you can instantly see which awards you've earned throughout the course of the game using the new trophy menu display; each time you earn a new award, you'll get a notification (there are A LOT of possible awards this time around, adding to the replay value).

3.0,"Beautiful, but tedious.","To sum up this game in one word: tedious. That's unfortunate, since there was so much that could have been done with the setting and theme.<br /><br />**First impressions...**<br /><br />The first thing you notice is that the traditional ""Nancy's desk"" intro is gone. So, too, is any sort of exposition; I felt as if I'd just been dropped into the desert with no backstory or idea of what was going on. As you have conversations with the suspects and phone friends, you start to put the pieces together, but that came fairly late in the game for me.<br /><br />Most notably, there are very few settings and few hotspots to interact with. There are really only two main locations, the campsite and the tomb. You can pan around the camp, but despite several close-up shots, there's rarely anything to click on. Some background animations (palm branches waving in the desert wind, perhaps some glowing embers from the campfire, scuttling scarabs) would have done wonders to bring the dig site to life. Inside the main tent, it feels like wasted space. You can't pan, and there's nothing to explore inside the bunks. Even items that seemed like they should be explorable (like a purse left out in the open) aren't clickable. You see shelves in the tent; my first thought was, ""aha, supplies!"" but once again, there's no hotspots. There are several snooping puzzles that require you to go through personal belongings, and as mentioned above, there's hardly anything clickable despite lots of potential ""hotspots"" (a digital camera that I was sure would have incriminating evidence, a voice recorder like the one from SAW, but I couldn't click on either).<br /><br />**Puzzles**<br /><br />The puzzles are tedious; it felt like all I kept doing was finding and translating hieroglyphs. On the Amateur Sleuth level, you can skip all the hieroglyph translation by clicking on the ""quick translate"" button. Even some of the puzzles shamelessly repeat themselves during the course of the game. You're given several archeological tools appropriate for a dig site; it's a shame that the game didn't require you to make more use of them.<br /><br />I kept getting lost in the tunnels. True, you're given a map, but it lacks a ""you are here"" feature, and the tunnels look very similar in some cases. More importantly, there was no sense of foreboding, no sense that Nancy really is being stalked by an otherworldly curse. Nancy debunks the ""curse"" events almost immediately after they happen, which takes away any sense of suspense that would have otherwise been generated. I felt no sense of urgency, no hair standing up on the back of my neck, nothing that seemed creepy/spooky like the yurei in [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]] (watery footprints, ghostly reflections, etc.).<br /><br />The character rendering and animation was generally good, but some of the mannerisms (Dylan's constantly putting his arm behind his head, Abdullah's accent) were grating and repetitive. Two of the character accents were particularly grating; Abdullah sounded like a close cousin of Antonio Banderas channeling Puss in Boots, and Jamila sounded like she just stepped out of a British boarding school (both are supposed to be Egyptian).<br /><br />**Chatting up the suspects**<br /><br />It didn't seem like there were many conversation branches to pursue, and some of the follow-up questions didn't make sense (a character would spend two or three minutes giving an answer, and the next question was ""why are you here?"").<br /><br />Some of the scripted conversations seemed a bit questionable. One involved a crack about the British Empire, and the other involved a scenario that sounded a lot like the Book of Revelation and the Rapture, if you subscribe to that sort of thing. This surprised me, as ND games are generally neutral towards political and religious themes.<br /><br />Character-wise, there seems to be more depth and backstory than in many ND games, and the ending is brilliant; you're never quite sure who the villain is until the very end (shades of Agatha Christie here).<br /><br />**Setting**<br /><br />I feel let down that modern-day Egypt was completely overlooked. Unlike [[ASIN:B0018XU9SQ Nancy Drew: The Phantom of Venice]] or [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]], where you had traditional foods, games, etc. from Italy and Japan, there's nothing to tie TMB to modern Egypt, only the ancient past. You only deal with hieroglyphs and no modern Arabic. A little of both would have worked wonders. It would have been awesome for Nancy to visit a traditional Cairo souk (market), ride a camel to see the pyramids and Sphynx at Giza (even a cutscene would have sufficed) or have to travel between the dig site and a museum to interview / look for clues. Instead, you're confined to one location with few people to talk to, mostly phone friends, which grew old quickly, but the remoteness of the dig site is a central part of the plot.<br /><br />The problem with TMB is that the temples and Egyptian artifacts lack any kind of context or historical explanation. I would have preferred to see TMB be more like [[ASIN:B000066ST3 Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand]], where Nancy was an intern in a museum. There, the educational games felt natural and I learned a lot at the same time. Another good example of the ancient Egyptian genre is [[ASIN:B0017AJMX8 Dracula Origin]]; it had one part that was set in modern Egypt; there you got to hunt for artifacts in the museum, translate hieroglyphs, and it was actually fun.<br /><br />**The new interface**<br /><br />I thought the new interface worked well and made it easy to access important information. The Hints Hotline was in use almost constantly, since I was frequently stuck (it progressively gives you hints until you have the option to see the full solution; this is done in red font, so you can avoid seeing the complete solution if you choose).<br /><br />Also, I  had some issues with the scrolling text boxes during conversations. The letters on the left-hand side kept getting chopped off, so you'd have to guess at the first letter or two of words. Not a major issue, but a bit annoying nonetheless.<br /><br />There are also phone charms to collect, but these seemed totally out of place in Ancient Egypt. In SAW, when you're in Japan, cell phone charms are all the rage and it makes sense to see them in the game, but it seemed out of place in an Egyptian tomb.<br /><br />**Final verdict:**<br /><br />Since I've always been interested in Egypt, there is some replay value; the graphics are simply gorgeous, and you'll see plenty of familiar names and faces from Ancient Egyptian culture, but if you're looking for edge-of-your seat drama like SAW, sadly Nancy won't find it in Egypt. The plot kind of grew on me as the game progressed, but more explorable areas, particularly above-ground, would have gone a long way to making TMB feel less claustrophobic.<br /><br />The teaser for ND27 looks promising!<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Beautiful graphics<br />+ Music<br />+ Ancient Egyptian culture<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Accents<br />- Lack of hotspots / animation<br />- Lack of areas to explore<br />- Repetitive puzzles","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HecsYnBaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HecsYnBaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HecsYnBaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HzNmB5sTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HzNmB5sTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HzNmB5sTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KS6QD13TL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KS6QD13TL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KS6QD13TL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jeaGU6HgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jeaGU6HgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jeaGU6HgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B007PLR9UG,B007XJ448A,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1336514048000,22,False,"Beautiful, but tedious.

5.0,A fine return to form in Nancy's 23rd outing...,"Shadow at the Water's Edge (SAW) is Nancy Drew's 23rd mystery with Her Interactive, and it's one of the most impressive in terms of story, puzzles, and spooky ambience. Nancy is taking a well-deserved vacation at the Ryokan Hiei, a traditional inn in Kyoto, Japan. From the moment Nancy arrives, there are spooky omens, and the Shimizu family isn't very talkative about the family tragedy that hangs over the ryokan. Part of Nancy's job is to teach English through the Japan Teacher Exchange program, so you'll have various homework assignments to grade in the evenings. Because you're teaching all day, the game takes place at night, adding to the creepy atmosphere.<br /><br />Shadow at the Water's Edge is one of the scariest games next to Curse of Blackmoor Manor (note that the game is rated E (10+), so there's no gore or violence, but there are some heart-stopping moments). Various paranormal phenomena follow Nancy as she attempts to discover the secrets hiding inside the ryokan, and these were genuinely scary, since several were still unexplained after the finale. This is also one of the longest Nancy Drew games, with ample opportunity for sleuthing, snooping, and interviewing. You'll have the opportunity to hop on the subway as well as conduct phone interviews in your quest for the truth behind the hauntings.<br /><br />The game designers did a good job on incorporating Japanese culture into the game. You'll find Harajuku-inspired fashion, traditional Japanese gardens, cute cell phone charms, and customizable cell phone avatars that you can assign to your cell contacts (design enough, and you can win an award at the end of the game). I loved the little authentic touches, like the very Japanese hot water heater perched over Yumi's apartment sink. Nancy also has a Japanese-English dictionary to help her translate written items. The in-game music ranges from soothing, traditional Japanese instrumentals to ominous taiko drumming and sudden, eerie starts and stops that will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck.<br /><br />Gameplay is nonlinear.

Shadow at the Water's Edge (SAW) is Nancy Drew's 23rd mystery with Her Interactive, and it's one of the most impressive in terms of story, puzzles, and spooky ambience. Nancy is taking a well-deserved vacation at the Ryokan Hiei, a traditional inn in Kyoto, Japan. From the moment Nancy arrives, there are spooky omens, and the Shimizu family isn't very talkative about the family tragedy that hangs over the ryokan. Part of Nancy's job is to teach English through the Japan Teacher Exchange program, so you'll have various homework assignments to grade in the evenings. Because you're teaching all day, the game takes place at night, adding to the creepy atmosphere.<br /><br />Shadow at the Water's Edge is one of the scariest games next to Curse of Blackmoor Manor (note that the game is rated E (10+), so there's no gore or violence, but there are some heart-stopping moments). Various paranormal phenomena follow Nancy as she attempts to discover the secrets hiding inside the ryokan, and these were genuinely scary, since several were still unexplained after the finale. This is also one of the longest Nancy Drew games, with ample opportunity for sleuthing, snooping, and interviewing. You'll have the opportunity to hop on the subway as well as conduct phone interviews in your quest for the truth behind the hauntings.<br /><br />The game designers did a good job on incorporating Japanese culture into the game. You'll find Harajuku-inspired fashion, traditional Japanese gardens, cute cell phone charms, and customizable cell phone avatars that you can assign to your cell contacts (design enough, and you can win an award at the end of the game). I loved the little authentic touches, like the very Japanese hot water heater perched over Yumi's apartment sink. Nancy also has a Japanese-English dictionary to help her translate written items. The in-game music ranges from soothing, traditional Japanese instrumentals to ominous taiko drumming and sudden, eerie starts and stops that will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck.<br /><br />Gameplay is nonlinear.

4.0,A fun (if short) romp inspired by the works of Poe.,"""Warnings at Waverly Academy"" (WAC) is Nancy Drew's 21st adventure with HerInteractive. In WAC, Nancy goes undercover at Waverly Academy, a posh girls-only boarding school in New York. Some of the girls have been getting threatening notes from ""the Black Cat,"" which are then followed by malicious accidents. Nancy, as Becca Sawyer, has been asked by the school's headmistress to investigate.<br /><br />Unlike the previous installments [[ASIN:B001ANDJJU Nancy Drew: The Haunting of Castle Malloy]] and [[ASIN:B0026EV5FW Nancy Drew: Ransom of the Seven Ships]], there are five characters (suspects) that you have to befriend: Izzy Romero, Mel Corbalis, Leela Yadav, Corine Myers, and Rachel Hubbard. True, the girls fall into somewhat predictable stereotypes (the jock, the Queen Bee, the Goth girl), but they've been given distinct personalities with backstories.<br /><br />The first comparison that springs to mind is the benchmark of Nancy Drew games, [[ASIN:B0002ZALES Nancy Drew: Curse of Blackmoor Manor]]. The game is not nearly as long (or difficult!) as Blackmoor Manor. Other than the fact that both games take place in drafty Gothic buildings, there's really not much in common.<br /><br />The school grounds are compact and make for easy (if limited) exploration. Inside the school, you have access to about ten or so rooms during the course of the game, along with limited space outside. I would have liked to see more areas to explore, particularly outside (there's an inviting-looking gazebo I kept wanting to explore). The puzzles fit well into the storyline. There's some filler in the form of ""you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" puzzles; if Nancy wants access to a particular item, she has to do something for another girl first. But these puzzles fit well and are subject-related (a science puzzle, a math problem or two). You're also responsible for working in the school's snack shop (you have to do it at least once a (game) day or you get demerits).  You can die (there's a handy Second Chance feature) or get expelled (say, for pulling the fire alarm, too many noise violations, picking locks, or sneaking out at night), but it's smooth sailing for the most part.<br /><br />Even though Nancy has had plenty of techno-tools in her arsenal in previous games, WAC felt totally current: you keep in touch with the other girls via Twitter, there's mention of MySpace (called URSpace), and part of your job is to help with the school's website. HerInteractive even did a cool ""Watching Waverly"" Twitter soap opera before the game's launch (the Twitter script can be read at  twitter dot com/HerInteractive/watchingwaverly And the school has a ""website"" at warningsatwaverlyacademy dot com (the campus map got my hopes up that it would be explorable).<br /><br />Overall, WAC was short, but fun. You really get a feel for the girls, the school, and the mystery. The historical storyline tied in well with the overall theme. The graphics look great, particularly the character animations (special mention to the modeling of Rachel; I thought I was watching a movie during cutscenes, she was so realistic). The music was perfect without being intrusive. There's a fun Easter Egg that you can find (there's probably more), and references to earlier ND games (including the ever-present Koko Kringles).

5.0,"Singing gondoliers, gelato, nightclubs and sleuthing, oh my!","In Nancy's eighteenth adventure from HerInteractive, Nancy makes good use of her passport in her second international outing, this time to Venice, Italy during Carnevale. Her old friend Prudence Rutherford (first heard from in [[ASIN:B000066ST3 Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand]]) has enlists her to discover the identity of the Phantom, a masked robber who's been making off with priceless antiques. The mysterious Phantom escapes detection, having knowledge of the security systems for each site.<br /><br />Nancy's home base is Prudence's old palazzo, the Ca' Nascosta, now in a sad state of disrepair after Prudence sold it to a penny-pinching, ladder-climbing socialite. Nancy shares a room with Helena Berg, a young German journalist who is in love with Venice and hopes to move there. A British art restorer, Colin Baxter, develops a huge crush on Nancy while working on the Ca' and tries in vain to win her affection.<br /><br />Italian culture is everywhere, and Nancy must even learn some basic Italian in order to participate in an important stakeout. You carry an Italian dictionary, which comes in useful for translating signs and documents. The background audio includes several conversations in Italian, but if you don't speak Italian, these aren't crucial to the game. Many times, characters are simply commenting on the Phantom and his adventures, or about personal events. Also included are several flavors of Italian gelato, the Italian card game Scopa, the various Carnevale masks, and Venetian architecture.<br /><br />Nancy is working with the Guardia di Finanza, Italy's version of the FBI, to track the Phantom. Because it's Carnevale season, there aren't enough officers to tail him, so Nancy is given a PDA with tracking capabilities. There are several possible suspects, including Antonio Fango, the shady IT dealer who works across from Nancy's temporary residence, Enrico Tazza , a member of the Machiano Crime Syndicate and a fence for stolen goods , Colin, who has past secrets to hide, and the mysterious (and ungracious) hostess La Contessa Margherita Fauberg. Nancy has three modes of transportation: on foot (free), via vaporetto (water taxi, free), or by singing gondolier (between five and fifteen euros per trip). The main map is clearly laid out and is easy to navigate.<br /><br />Like [[ASIN:B0009X6QJM Nancy Drew: Secret Of the Old Clock]], Nancy must earn money in order to purchase items needed in her investigation, including books and costume accessories. You begin the game with 200 Euros, and if you budget very wisely, you won't need extra money (those fashionable shopping trips, gelato cones and singing gondoliers really add up!). If you find yourself running short, there are several ways to earn extra income, including dancing in a nightclub dressed as a slinky black cat (!).I loved the variety of the nightclub dancing, although the character animation was jerky and I would have liked to see Nancy move more than just rotating her wrist in-between moves. From my own experience, you can earn between two to over thirty euros per dance depending on how well you nail the cues (for the hearing-impaired: the dance cues are auditory, but flashing colored lights also tell you which colored button to press).<br /><br />I played the game on the Senior Detective level, which offers fewer step-by-step hints (there's no to-do list, for one) and more difficult puzzles, and the majority of the puzzles were sufficiently intuitive, but still challenging. The graphics are gorgeous as always; in scenes of the canals, visible from your bedroom balcony, the water ripples in real time. If you choose to ride a gondola (the amount varies depending on the gondolier), you're treated to a combination of still photos of Venice and rendered scenery which proves quite effective (along with the various Italian-language serenades taken from Italian opera and popular songs).

The protagonist is Father Arno Moriani, a priest sent by the Vatican to investigate a local Transylvanian doctor who is slated for sainthood. But his seemingly simple investigation into the good doctor takes several unpredictable twists, and he soon finds himself plunged headfirst into a world of shadowy vampires, a battle that threatens not only his faith but also his life.<br /><br />The main failing of the game is the *absence* of vampires; you only deal directly with the title character at the very end of a long and tiring journey. The rest of the time, you're researching obscure texts, closely examining artwork, and leafing through hefty tomes of Romanian history that deal with the origins of Dracula, or Vlad Tepes. There are also undercurrents of WWII even though the game is set in 1920 (yep, evil Nazis and bad German accents!). There are only a handful of characters, but the ones you do interact with are generally fleshed out, with unique personalities and solid voicework.<br /><br />The puzzles themselves are some of the better ones I've seen in the last few years; there's a wide variety of strategy board games, locks, word puzzles, and inventory-based puzzles. Phlebotomy takes up a large part of the game; if you're squeamish, you probably won't go for the graphic how-to on drawing your own blood several times (""now all that's left is to push the needle deep into the vein!""), or poring over cells under a microscope.  Generally, the solutions are quite obvious, although one of the end puzzles requires careful observation and piecing together clues collected throughout the game.

4.0,Lose yourself in a vanished Spain...,"I'd eagerly awaiting Agon: The Lost Sword of Toledo ever since 2005, when I was living and working in Madrid (and visiting Toledo and other cities on the weekends). I played the game slowly, savoring its atmosphere and comparing it to the Spain I knew from living and working there on two different occasions. I had previously downloaded the demo, so I was familiar with the inventory system and one or two of the locations featured in the game.<br /><br />I did have a bit of trouble installing it, but after several tries, I was rewarded and started by exploring the ""Extra Features: More Details"" option on the main menu. Not having played Agon: The Mysterious Codex other than the demos, I was not familiar with much of Professor Hunt's backstory and appreciated the brief synopsis of his journey thus far. ""Extra Features"" includes Dorothy's Table: The Journey to Toledo, which chronicles the Professor's journey via period postcards, maps, and letters. Some of his adventures called to mind stories in Washington Irving's excellent ""Tales of the Alhambra."" The table in question is set with Spanish ceramic tiles and pottery, a nice touch, as well as a framed photo of the game's cover art. Also available is an interesting little biography of the professor at age twelve that hints of supernatural abilities.<br /><br />On to the game itself: the opening cinematic sets the tone as Professor Hunt describes his arduous journey to reach Toledo. His first inhabitant is less than welcoming; he shares his coach with a silent, disapproving priest. Arriving in the picturesque and typical Spanish plaza, he sets out to find Salvador Diez-Palencia, an art teacher from whom his wife Dorothy had taken lessons. There are a few townspeople with whom you are able to interact as you seek to locate the painter's house. I wished that more of the square was available for exploration, as it was beautifully rendered (despite the beautiful rendering, there is generally little to interact with in any given frame).<br /><br />Arriving at the painter's house, he is greeted by Salvador's daughter Carmen, who regrets to inform him that her father passed away from tuberculosis a year ago, but Hunt is welcome to stay in her home for a few days. Carmen has troubles of her own, including the fact that her beloved Francisco is currently in jail on theft charges, and she's been railroaded into marriage with the son of Alonso Garcia de la Rica, a local influential politician. Hunt promises to do what he can to smooth out the situation, and the real adventure begins as he pieces together the clues left behind by the crafty painter, who also had a talent for making music boxes. The professor finds himself in a web of intrigue surrounding the famous Lost Sword of Toledo, crafted by Francisco's grandfather Juan Candelas, and must ferret out the true villain in its disappearance. His search for the AGON is largely secondary here.<br /><br />Lost Sword of Toledo is largely dialogue-driven, and as other reviewers have mentioned, there is no apparent way to skip over the vast amounts of dialogue. However, there is a feature where you can reread all conversations, which is useful for uncovering clues that may have been missed the first time around. Subtitles are available, but at least one puzzle is purely based on listening to musical pieces.<br /><br />My greatest curiosity (and concern) was on the authenticity of turn-of-the-century Toledo, a city I came to know and love as I visited it several times, spending happy hours wandering the warren of medieval streets. The early screenshots looked promising, and I needn't have worried; Private Moon has captured the feel of Toledo amazingly well, down to the spiky towers of the Alcazar visible from a character's garden, bundles of electrical cables that run along the outside of buildings, the Moorish architecture (brickwork arches, glazed azulejo ceramics in geometric patterns), and even the ""Ayuntamiento de Toledo"" engraved on sewer covers. Standing in Carmen's courtyard, if you pan up to look at the sky, the white-hot summer sun is blinding. In another courtyard, a fountain splashes gently as you sit surrounded by elegant glazed tiles and plants. You are able to pan 360 degrees, and scrolling generally handled smoothly.<br /><br />The interiors of the buildings are equally authentic, down to the aged sepia portraits that hang on the walls, the shields, swords, and family coats of arms, and trinkets that line the shelves. The game excels at reproducing authentic print materials such as great works of Spanish literature (yes, an English translation of Don Quixote makes an appearance, as does a Spanish-language text by Calderon de la Barca), books on tauromaquia (bullfighting), the artwork of El Greco (which is on display throughout the real Toledo), and other treasures. If you're fluent in Spanish, it's absolutely fascinating to take the time to read through some of these transcriptions; they felt so real, I could practically feel the brittle pages between my fingers.<br /><br />The music is pleasant enough, with Spanish influences here and there, but at many points the music would either loop incessantly or lapse into silence. The sound effects, particularly the birdsong and outdoor noises, more than made up for any lack, though. Voice acting is decent; it's obvious that several of the actors portraying Spaniards are native Spanish speakers, while others are passable. Character modeling is less successful that the gorgeous backgrounds; oftentimes blocky, the animations are repetitive and jerky, and many of the characters exhibit very limited facial expressions ( MZone Studio of France did much of the graphic rendering). Transitions are presented in a comic-book style of panes, which was an unusual (and enjoyable) addition. The inventory system is simple and you are rarely called upon to combine items, nor do you carry more items than necessary (you can minimize the inventory bar by pressing the spacebar).<br /><br />The puzzles themselves are logical and mostly straightforward, and only one or two required a hint to proceed. Thankfully, there are a variety of puzzles: some mathematical, some astrological, some based on mechanical manipulation, and others on technology of the era. The game was of a decent length, enough that gameplay comfortably covered a week's worth of evenings, and the reproductions of print materials and the gorgeous atmosphere of the locations will make you want to stop and linger (I find myself returning to Carmen's courtyard again and again).<br /><br />Final verdict: if you enjoy period dramas, leisurely exploring, and uncovering tales of betrayal and family secrets, Agon: The Lost Sword of Toledo is for you.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/419JhWGPJ4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/419JhWGPJ4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/419JhWGPJ4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41RZTwvcgEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41RZTwvcgEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41RZTwvcgEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51mGSmySDEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51mGSmySDEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51mGSmySDEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B001ESNNI8,B001ESNNI8,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1226026243000,6,False,"Lose yourself in a vanished Spain...

5.0,Sexy bloodsucker battles sleuthing scholar...,"In yet another PC adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula ([[ASIN:B0017HIH78 Microids: Dracula 1 & 2 DJC]], [[ASIN:B001AH7VZE Microids: Dracula III]]), Frogwares has created some interesting twists on a beloved tale. You take the role of Van Helsing, vampire hunter, on the bloody trail of Count Dracula. The game begins in London, where Van Helsing has just received a letter from Jonathan Harker.<br /><br />Dracula: Origin is plenty dark and gory; the game is rated T, and there's certainly a lot of blood and gore (including graphic torture, mutilation and satanic rituals). The game's locations (London, Vienna, Cairo, Transylvania) sparkle and really add depth to the story; puzzle-wise, you spend a large amount of time in Cairo exploring the market, museum, and several residences. Sadly, the section in Transylvania felt more like a tacked-on afterthought. The ending is super-brief, but I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Graphics: the prerendered backgrounds are generally very intricately rendered, with period touches (detailed paintings, tapestries, etc.). The character animations are somewhat less successful; Van Helsing's movements are wooden (this is a third-person perspective, so you're watching Van Helsing move *a lot*). The cutscenes are beautiful, though. Lip synching is somewhat off in cutscenes, but it's generally not a distraction. The load screens are more of a watercolor wash instead of rendered (and load times are short).<br /><br />Sound: the background music is generally unobtrusive, with a piano-based score that includes fear-drenched organ and quivering strings from time to time. For some reason, the music in Cairo reminded me strongly of Big Fish's soundtrack to their Blood Ties game. Sound effects are very good. It's obvious that English was the second language; there are some subtitles in particularly that don't mesh with the recorded dialogue. Also, Van Helsing got on my nerves; his melodramatic, gasped ""Closed!"" at finding doors locked was grating.<br /><br />Gameplay: Dracula: Origin is an inventory-based game. You only pick up what you need, and it's generally pretty obvious what goes where (although some solutions are a bit of a stretch). There are several puzzle varieties including decoding, sliders, logic puzzles, and find-the-items. The game leans towards the easy side, with plenty of hand-holding; on many occasions, I longed for a more difficult solution. It would have been nice if two different difficulty levels had been included (beginner and advanced), but I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzles.<br /><br />Are there some shortcuts in design and graphics that I found annoying? Yes. But Dracula: Origin looks great, plays well, and is certainly one of the better-looking adventure games to come out recently. Because of its intuitive puzzles, this is a perfect first game for those new to adventure gaming. And fans of vampire lore will find plenty to sink their fangs into as well.",[],B0017AJMX8,B0017AJMX8,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1214697971000,18,True,"Sexy bloodsucker battles sleuthing scholar...

4.0,A wild journey through criminal minds,"Agatha Christie: Evil Under the Sun is AWE Game's third Agatha Christie adaptation for the PC, and as such, has made admirable improvements over its predecessors, with a few small glitches. Based on Dame Agatha's [[ASIN:0425129608 Evil under the Sun (Hercule Poirot Mysteries)]], it is the tale of seemingly unrelated guests vacationing on a nearly-deserted British island early in WWII. However, all is not quiet in this apparent paradise; Arlena Stuart-Marshall, a rich and beautiful actress, turns up dead on an isolated beach, and nearly everyone has some connection either to the murder or the strange goings-on on Seadrift Island.<br /><br />The game opens with the unique premise that Poirot and Hastings are in Poirot's London apartment during an air raid, and in order to distract themselves, Poirot offers to retell the details of his latest case, which received scant publicity due to being upstaged by Hitler. Poirot offers the services of the Finger of Suspicion, a ""magical"" device that helps eliminate suspects if you get stuck. During the tale, Hastings will jump back and forth between Seadrift Island, 1940 and Poirot's London office as the two share details of the case.<br /><br />Unlike the previous AWE game [[ASIN:B000GCGQ6Y Agatha Christie : Murder on the Orient Express]], where you played as Poirot (voiced by David Suchet, the BBC Poirot), in EUtS you play as Poirot's friend Captain Hastings as you retrace Poirot's footsteps leading up the the murder and its investigation. However, your physical appearance is that of Poirot, and your thoughts alternate between Hastings and Poirot as the two banter about clues and suspects. Sound confusing? It is at times. Also, David Suchet didn't reprise his voicework here, deferring to the capable Kevin Delaney instead. However, the time travel / body swap gimmick works, and the clever writing results in comic relief.<br /><br />There are no fewer than twenty possible suspects, and each has their own motive. There is not one, but several crimes unfolding simultaneously, including subplots involving a fascist spy, drug smuggling, past murders, pirate ghosts, hidden treasure, small thefts, and of course, Arlena's murder. Also, Seadrift Island and the Smuggler's Rest hotel are incredibly vast compared to the first Agatha Christie game [[ASIN:B000U8DTW8 Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None]], offering hours of exploration.<br /><br />Graphically, the game is flawless, including the Art Deco hotel details and elaborate period costumes. However, I had to giggle on several occasions at a few of the characters who really, really looked like men in drag, especially during cutscenes. I wondered if that was part of the deception at first, but no. Another graphic improvement was in the game's extensive use of ambient effects such as rolling fog, moving shafts of sunlight, distant waves, and rustling leaves that helped to bring static 2D backgrounds to life. The game's voice acting is generally very good, with the exception of some truly bad German accents, and the music is perfectly tailored to suit the mood. The cinematic cutscenes are beautifully executed, and many times are for comic effect as Poirot's grumpy face is featured in close-up, the crinkling of his eyes expressing his disapproval.<br /><br />The inventory system remains unchanged from previous games, but thankfully, you carry few unnecessary items. Generally, the puzzles are inventory-based and are straightforward, sometimes requiring you to combine items or examine items more closely. Another new twist is the stopwatch; in this game, you time several routes around the island to the scene of the murder to determine whose alibis are sound. There are also numerous documents that are added to Hastings/Poirot's notebook that shed light on past events that are connected to the murder. Poirot also engages in eavesdropping on several occasions, and shadowing shady characters (and ghosts). Another pleasant addition is the use of chemical testing to determine contents of items found in suspects' rooms and at crime scenes.<br /><br />Two small gripes: when testing evidence, the results are delivered automatically, with no chance for trial and error. A little more freedom of experimentation in determining content would have been nice. Similarly, Poirot is required to play darts at one point, and he wins automatically. I was hoping for a little eye-hand coordination practice instead of having the computer do it for me. Also, some players had issues with gameplay crashes and glitches, but the game ran smoothly on my above-specs computer.<br /><br />Overall, this is a welcome addition to an impressive series of games that capture the diabolically clever murder puzzles in Dame Agatha's famed mysteries while bringing bygone eras to vivid life. The touches of humor and vivid environment, combined with the extended gameplay, make this the best entry in the series by far, and fans of murder mysteries and adventure games should definitely add this gem to their collection.",[],B000UQURQ6,B000UQURQ6,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1211716136000,10,False,"A wild journey through criminal minds Agatha Christie: Evil Under the Sun is AWE Game's third Agatha Christie adaptation for the PC, and as such, has made admirable improvements over its predecessors, with a few small glitches.

The cinematic cutscenes are beautifully executed, and many times are for comic effect as Poirot's grumpy face is featured in close-up, the crinkling of his eyes expressing his disapproval.<br /><br />The inventory system remains unchanged from previous games, but thankfully, you carry few unnecessary items. Generally, the puzzles are inventory-based and are straightforward, sometimes requiring you to combine items or examine items more closely. Another new twist is the stopwatch; in this game, you time several routes around the island to the scene of the murder to determine whose alibis are sound. There are also numerous documents that are added to Hastings/Poirot's notebook that shed light on past events that are connected to the murder. Poirot also engages in eavesdropping on several occasions, and shadowing shady characters (and ghosts). Another pleasant addition is the use of chemical testing to determine contents of items found in suspects' rooms and at crime scenes.<br /><br />Two small gripes: when testing evidence, the results are delivered automatically, with no chance for trial and error. A little more freedom of experimentation in determining content would have been nice. Similarly, Poirot is required to play darts at one point, and he wins automatically. I was hoping for a little eye-hand coordination practice instead of having the computer do it for me. Also, some players had issues with gameplay crashes and glitches, but the game ran smoothly on my above-specs computer.<br /><br />Overall, this is a welcome addition to an impressive series of games that capture the diabolically clever murder puzzles in Dame Agatha's famed mysteries while bringing bygone eras to vivid life. The touches of humor and vivid environment, combined with the extended gameplay, make this the best entry in the series by far, and fans of murder mysteries and adventure games should definitely add this gem to their collection.",wild journey criminal mind agatha christie evil sun awe game third agatha christie adaptation pc made admirable improvement predecessor small glitch based dame agathas asin evil sun hercule poirot mystery tale seemingly unrelated guest vacationing nearlydeserted british island early wwii however quiet apparent paradise arlena stuartmarshall rich beautiful actress turn dead isolated beach nearly everyone connection either murder strange goingson seadrift islandbr br game open unique premise poirot hastings poirots london apartment air raid order distract poirot offer retell detail latest case received scant publicity due upstaged hitler poirot offer service finger suspicion magical device help eliminate suspect get stuck tale hastings jump back forth seadrift island poirots london office two share detail casebr br unlike previous awe game asinbgcgqy agatha christie murder orient express played poirot voiced david suchet bbc poirot euts play poirots friend captain hastings retrace poirots footstep leading murder investigation however physical appearance poirot thought alternate hastings poirot two banter clue suspect sound confusing time also david suchet didnt reprise voicework deferring capable kevin delaney instead however time travel body swap gimmick work clever writing result comic reliefbr br fewer twenty possible suspect motive one several crime unfolding simultaneously including subplots involving fascist spy drug smuggling past murder pirate ghost hidden treasure small theft course arlenas murder also seadrift island smuggler rest hotel incredibly vast compared first agatha christie game asinbudtw agatha christie none offering hour explorationbr br graphically game flawless including art deco hotel detail elaborate period costume however giggle several occasion character really really looked like men drag especially cutscenes wondered part deception first another graphic improvement game extensive use ambient effect rolling fog moving shaft sunlight distant wave rustling leaf helped bring static background life game voice acting generally good exception truly bad german accent music perfectly tailored suit mood cinematic cutscenes beautifully executed many time comic effect poirots grumpy face featured closeup crinkling eye expressing disapprovalbr br inventory system remains unchanged previous game thankfully carry unnecessary item generally puzzle inventorybased straightforward sometimes requiring combine item examine item closely another new twist stopwatch game time several route around island scene murder determine whose alibi sound also numerous document added hastingspoirots notebook shed light past event connected murder poirot also engages eavesdropping several occasion shadowing shady character ghost another pleasant addition use chemical testing determine content item found suspect room crime scenesbr br two small gripe testing evidence result delivered automatically chance trial error little freedom experimentation determining content would nice similarly poirot required play dart one point win automatically hoping little eyehand coordination practice instead computer also player issue gameplay crash glitch game ran smoothly abovespecs computerbr br overall welcome addition impressive series game capture diabolically clever murder puzzle dame agathas famed mystery bringing bygone era vivid life touch humor vivid environment combined extended gameplay make best entry series far fan murder mystery adventure game definitely add gem collection

5.0,Delving into the dark side of New Orleans...,"On Nancy's seventeenth mystery, she's plunged deep into a world of illusions, secret societies, family secrets, and dark magic in New Orleans. Nancy had only planned to visit a friend of a friend while sightseeing the French Quarter, but as fans know, nothing ever goes as planned. Orphan Henry Bolet, a self-styled Goth with dyed black hair, eyeliner, and tattoos, is the sole heir of his only relative, great-uncle Bruno. Bruno was unconventional to say the least: an unmarried dentist, he had a large collection of glass eyes (which Nancy must find throughout the game), domesticated ""pets"" (some more tame than others) that he trained to perform tricks, and he was caretaker of the nearby cemetery, which explains the model cemetery and list of ""residents."" When Nancy goes to check up on Henry, she's knocked out by a skeleton, and her sleuthing skills kick into high gear as the late Bruno's secrets come to light. He was the last known owner of The Whisperer, a crystal skull from antiquity that is said to give its owner immortality.<br /><br />Bruno's mansion is filled with odd collections of games and books, and the slanting, twisted halls are bathed only in candlelight as the fierce storm has knocked out the electricity. Nancy must solve the mystery of Bruno's death and the location of the Whisperer while battling wasps, poisonous spiders, cranky alligators and other hazards. On this trip, her friend Bess Marvin provides moral (and sleuthing) support in the French Quarter. Reluctant Bess plays an important role and is the key to solving several puzzles; she must dig up clues and interview suspects in order to help the investigation progress. Players switch between Nancy and Bess by calling each other via cell phone.<br /><br />There are several potential suspects in Dr. Bolet's death: his nephew Henry, his housekeeper Renee, (who dabbles in voodoo), Dr. Gilbert Buford (Bruno's best friend and physician), and Lamont, owner of Zeke's curio shop. This may be one of the most complete Nancy Drew titles; there is ample backstory and character development, including appearances from characters in earlier ND games. The plot twists had me thinking I knew who the villain was until the very end, when it turned out I'd been wrong. Also, this ending was a vast improvement over the last three ND games, which featured lackluster endings and villains. Puzzles are varied, including several arcade-style games, musical puzzles (these are closed captioned), riddles, and matching games. I can't think of a single puzzle that qualified as filler. There is plenty to explore outside the mansion, including a mazelike cemetery and garden. My only gripes would be with the underdeveloped mansion (you can only explore five rooms, including Renee's bedroom, an empty spare room (where exactly does Henry sleep??), and the study) and limited exploration of the French Quarter (more variety would have been nice).<br /><br />The graphics are at an all-time high. Lightning flashes and dynamic rain really create an atmosphere of dread. Candles flicker in the gloom. The game starts with a warning to play with the lights off...this isn't because of the scare factor, but rather because the game takes place at night, in the rain, by candlelight. If you try playing with the lights on, you literally won't be able to see. Character animations are fluid and natural. Cutscenes are cinematic. All of these create a feeling of realism unmatched in earlier games. The sound effects are equally impressive, from the different rain sounds (rain on windows, foliage, and rooftops) to the haunting snippets of jazz and foreboding music that fade in and out at random.<br /><br />There is also a great deal of humor present, including nods to earlier games (there are three Easter eggs to discover). One of the puzzles involves finding graveyard denizens via a series of clues which lead to name puns. I was laughing out loud as I finally put two and two together.<br />Some parents may be hesitant to purchase this game because of its focus on death (cemeteries, skeletons) and dark magic (voodoo, spells, magic herbs, curses), but these elements are handled tastefully. There are some genuinely creepy moments (such as a meeting that Bess must infiltrate), but no worse than one would find in a PG halloween movie.<br />This was by far the most entertaining, well-put-together Nancy Drew game that I've had the pleasure to play (and I've played all seventeen numerous times).

3.0,Some improvements over the last few disappointing ND games,"I've played all of Her Interactive's Nancy Drew games, and the last several games were a disappointment to me ([[ASIN:B000FW16W4 Nancy Drew: Danger by Design]] and [[ASIN:B000II066M Nancy Drew: The Creature of Kapu Cave]] in particular). Danger by Design at least had a fascinating backstory, but the weak, ridiculous ending ruined any good feelings I might have had. Kapu Cave was just...bland. Boring from beginning to end, there was NO compelling story and the ""puzzles"" were mind-numbing (sorting of bug poop and making endless shell necklaces to earn more money), with nothing ""spooky"" about the ""mystery.""<br /><br />White Wolf of Icicle Creek is more engaging than the last few Nancy Drew games. This time, Nancy's in the Great White North at a skiing lodge owned by Chantal Moique. Mysterious goings-on like food poisoning, guest injuries, and explosions have been scaring off Chantal's guests. To add to the mystery, a white wolf has been seen (and heard) at the time of many incidents.<br /><br />The cast of suspects includes Ollie, the lodge's handyman, Lou, a college art student from California, Yanni, a champion skier from the Eastern European nation of Freedonia, Bill, a Canadian construction worker who's here to ice fish, and Guadalupe, a mysterious birdwatcher with a secret. As the game progresses, you'll discover hidden secrets and motives about each one through snooping through their personal belongings; after all, Nancy's taken on the job of maid and cook, so you're responsible for housekeeping every day.<br /><br />Which brings me to the first major flaw. Ever since Secret of Shadow Ranch, ND games have featured the annoying (and time-filling) element of ""chores."" Generally, these seem like things that adults thought would be fun for kids. Generally, these are a nuisance rather than being fun, and White Wolf is no exception. In fact, White Wolf forces you to clean rooms once a day and cook three times a day for the entire game. This is tedious and cuts down on available time to explore, as does a feature from one of the first ND games, [[ASIN:B00005LVWL Nancy Drew Treasure In The Royal Tower]]: the frostbite factor. Every time Nancy goes outside, you have to closely monitor the ""frostbite"" bar at the top of the screen. If Nancy gets too cold, she freezes to death. This also means that she can only be outdoors until around 5 pm every day, forcing you to advance the game to the next day unless you enjoy wandering for hours inside the lodge. Like several earlier games, you use the alarm clock in Nancy's room to advance the game.<br /><br />Since this is the sixteenth ND game, I suppose it's natural that several puzzles feel recycled. Many are easily solvable and intuitive for the most part, except for the most frustrating puzzle I've ever played: Fox and Geese. A board game similar to checkers, you are forced to beat it not once, but three times. Even with a walkthrough, it literally took me several frustrating days. I was so frustrated that I nearly walked away from the game for good.<br /><br />You do get to interact with the white wolf, who helps you to solve several puzzles. This is a definite improvement over befriending the killer whale in [[ASIN:B0000CEM5O Nancy Drew: Danger on Deception Island]], as you can actually give the wolf commands and have her help you solve the mystery. The wolf graphics were generally quite realistic, and game graphics were good overall, especially the outdoors scenes when you're walking through the snowy mountains.<br /><br />I didn't see the villain coming from the clues throughout the game, so Her Interactive did a good job with the ""a-ha"" factor.

4.0,A haunting vacation you'll never forget...,"In the independently developed Scratches, you play as Michael Arthate, a British horror writer who's hard-pressed to finish his sophomore novel. In an attempt to seek inspiration, you arrange to stay at a dilapidated Victorian manner in the English countryside. The next three days will change your life forever. If I had to sum up Scratches in one word, it would be dark. Dark ambiance, dark motivations, dark secrets await you.<br /><br />The game is set in the year 1976, and during the course of your investigations you'll revisit the shocking past of Blackwood Manor. Feverish dreams (or are they reality?) keep you from sleeping, and there are sounds that can't be explained away by creaky old houses. You are drawn deeper and deeper into the mystery of James Blackwood and his misfortunes. The only sound in the manor is the grandfather clock, the squeak of ancient stairs, and your lonely footsteps...until night falls.<br /><br />The game's Argentinian creators Agust&iacute;n Cordes and Alejandro Graziani are horror fanatics, and their devotion to their craft shows in loving homage to Lovecraft and Easter Eggs that poke fun at other adventure games. Scratches truly shines in creating a foreboding (dare I say downright evil??) atmosphere without gore. At times, the horrifying music by Cellar of Rats makes your hair stand on end when you realize that you're not alone. Every small nuance has been seen to, from the reflection of light in cut crystal to the trinkets that line the house. Blackwood Manor is almost an art museum, what with the numerous reproductions of famous paintings. Although the prerendered environments are lush and lifelike, the animations left a lot to be desired, but hey, this is an independent developer's first game, so I'm not going to fault them on that. Like many horror games, there are ""standard"" areas to explore, like a crypt, chapel, greenhouse, cellar and garage (after playing Scratches, you might avoid going into your basement for a while). You may also recognize a familiar name in the credits: Jonathan Boakes, famed creator of [[ASIN:B0000A341P Dark Fall: The Journal]]  and [[ASIN:B0002BID5Q Dark Fall: Lights Out]].<br /><br />Although some reviewers complain that the first third of the game moves very slowly (you are mainly exploring the manor at this point), I found the pacing to be brilliant. Little clues gradually emerge as you scour the house looking for candles on your first night...stacks of old newspapers and faded scraps of paper start to raise questions. You're able to phone several outside sources for help as the game progresses: your friend Jerry, your secretary Barbara, and two other surprise guests that are directly involved in Blackwood Manor's shady past.<br /><br />The puzzles are largely intuitive and inventory-driven (no combination locks or devilish slider puzzles, thank goodness). The inventory management is adequate, but you do acquire a bloated inventory by game's end, with no way to get rid of extra objects.<br /><br />Scratches: Director's Cut features a patch, but I still found mouse performance to be severely laggy on an above-minimum-specs laptop, and a very frustrating lag on opening any doors that resulted in minute-long lockups every time I tried to enter or exit a room. Otherwise, I didn't run into any crashes or other bugs.<br /><br />This is the Director's Cut, which features improved resolution on the prerendered graphics, an alternate ending, and an additional brief chapter called The Final Visit, where you visit Blackwood Manor in the present day shortly before it's to be demolished. If you don't already own Scratches, this is the version to get.<br /><br />Fans of horror and adventure will enjoy Scratches. If you like Scratches, also check out indie [[ASIN:B000088NQB Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle]].

The only sound in the manor is the grandfather clock, the squeak of ancient stairs, and your lonely footsteps...until night falls.<br /><br />The game's Argentinian creators Agust&iacute;n Cordes and Alejandro Graziani are horror fanatics, and their devotion to their craft shows in loving homage to Lovecraft and Easter Eggs that poke fun at other adventure games. Scratches truly shines in creating a foreboding (dare I say downright evil??) atmosphere without gore. At times, the horrifying music by Cellar of Rats makes your hair stand on end when you realize that you're not alone. Every small nuance has been seen to, from the reflection of light in cut crystal to the trinkets that line the house. Blackwood Manor is almost an art museum, what with the numerous reproductions of famous paintings. Although the prerendered environments are lush and lifelike, the animations left a lot to be desired, but hey, this is an independent developer's first game, so I'm not going to fault them on that. Like many horror games, there are ""standard"" areas to explore, like a crypt, chapel, greenhouse, cellar and garage (after playing Scratches, you might avoid going into your basement for a while). You may also recognize a familiar name in the credits: Jonathan Boakes, famed creator of [[ASIN:B0000A341P Dark Fall: The Journal]]  and [[ASIN:B0002BID5Q Dark Fall: Lights Out]].<br /><br />Although some reviewers complain that the first third of the game moves very slowly (you are mainly exploring the manor at this point), I found the pacing to be brilliant. Little clues gradually emerge as you scour the house looking for candles on your first night...stacks of old newspapers and faded scraps of paper start to raise questions. You're able to phone several outside sources for help as the game progresses: your friend Jerry, your secretary Barbara, and two other surprise guests that are directly involved in Blackwood Manor's shady past.<br /><br />The puzzles are largely intuitive and inventory-driven (no combination locks or devilish slider puzzles, thank goodness). The inventory management is adequate, but you do acquire a bloated inventory by game's end, with no way to get rid of extra objects.<br /><br />Scratches: Director's Cut features a patch, but I still found mouse performance to be severely laggy on an above-minimum-specs laptop, and a very frustrating lag on opening any doors that resulted in minute-long lockups every time I tried to enter or exit a room. Otherwise, I didn't run into any crashes or other bugs.<br /><br />This is the Director's Cut, which features improved resolution on the prerendered graphics, an alternate ending, and an additional brief chapter called The Final Visit, where you visit Blackwood Manor in the present day shortly before it's to be demolished. If you don't already own Scratches, this is the version to get.<br /><br />Fans of horror and adventure will enjoy Scratches.

4.0,One little sailor boy left all alone....,"The first in a series of Agatha Christie PC games, And Then There Were None is a solid book-to-PC screen adaptation that faithfully captures the foreboding atmosphere of Ten Little Indians, Dame Agatha's original novel. Ten strangers are invited to a remote British island by their mysterious host U.N. Owen. Once assembled, they are each accused of committing murder, and all are to be put to death as put forth in the children's rhyme (choking, knives, bee sting, drowning....).<br /><br />Numerous changes have been made, the most visible being the addition of an eleventh character, Patrick Narracott. In the original novel, Fred Narracott was the boatman for the original party of ten, but was not present on the island. In the game, his brother Patrick has taken his place at the last minute, and is trapped on the island when his boat is disabled. The other characters are faithful to the original novel, although some of their backstories have been changed or enhanced.<br /><br />Much care has been taken to bring the manor house to life. There are numerous period details, from the 1930s swing music on the radio to the Art Deco light fixtures. Scenes are rendered in superb detail, helping to bring the manor to ominous life. In the original novel (and subsequent film adaptations), And Then There Were None is a locked room mystery; the island was not explored in any great depth, contributing to the claustrophobic feeling. In the game, much of the action takes place on locations across Shipwreck Island. Nearly all of these locations were created for the game and supported by additional in-game subplots. The only downside is the large amount of tedious backtracking to retrieve items as they are needed.<br /><br />Graphics look dated, and some of the character modeling is distorted (Doctor Armstrong looks like he's hiding a plastic rectangle in his mouth in closeups). Cutscenes serve to move the story along. Voice acting is a mixed bag--I kept feeling like Patrick was slipping into an American accent, but on the other hand Ms. Brent's wonderful accent (and appearance) reminded me of Diana Rigg in The Worst Witch. Judge Wargrave was another strong point in terms of voice acting. The music was pleasant, if repetitive.<br /><br />The inventory system is clunky; there is precious little use of many clickable items, so you spend the game lugging around useless objects (although Patrick will object to picking up some items, saying ""I'm no packrat.""). The developers put a strange amount of research and design into a major red herring (think of a Hitchcock film involing avians). Puzzles in general range from the intuitive to the outrageous (Patrick's solution to a ""thorny"" problem involves a ludicrous chain of events involving goats). The second installment, [[ASIN:B000GCGQ6Y Agatha Christie : Murder on the Orient Express]], has improved upon some of these shortcomings.<br /><br />The game's greatest accomplishment and tribute to Dame Agatha is in its foreboding atmosphere;  sheets of rain and lightning flash outside, dark storm clouds roll low over the island as you walk across it, and waves crash violently on shore.<br /><br />Generally, the additions to the original story work well. There is more of a WWII political atmosphere than in the original novel; there are references to Hitler, Nazis and sympathizers. The ending has been completely rewritten; in fact, there are no fewer than four possible endings (one ""happily ever after"" scenario and three not-so-happy alternatives) and one ""treat"" ending, that of Dame Agatha's original ending read as a voiceover with still renderings.<br /><br />The game also comes with a copy of Dame Agatha's original novel so you can compare the two for yourself. If you haven't read the original novel, I would suggest waiting until after you've finished the game (or better yet, read along as you play). Even though the ending has been rewritten, reading the story first will take away some of the gruesome surprises in store.

4.0,Something wicked this way comes...,"A barrow is an ancient burial ground, often in the form of mounds of earth or with standing stones such as Stonehenge. England is dotted with these ancient sites, labeled as ""tumuli"" on maps. In 18th century England, digging up barrows was a favorite hobby of the educated, resulting in damage of the sites.<br /><br />Cornwall, the southwestern tip of England, has a rich history of barrows. In Barrow Hill, a team of archaeologists is proceeding on a dig of the local barrow that features seven mysterious stones. The barrow has been left undisturbed except for the building of a service station and motel nearby, but once the team begins excavating, an ancient evil is unleashed on the land.  The barrow in the game is based on Looe, Cornwall, and features parallel structures such as an ancient pagan well, barrow, swamp and service station.<br /><br />Creator Matt Clark has put a phenomenal amount of time and energy into doing justice to the barrows and Cornish legends, and as a bonus there is a link to a webpage talking about the history of Cornwall, barrows, and the making of the game (I was expecting something more polished from the blurb on the back of the box). Clark was aided on Barrow Hill by horror master Jonathan Boakes, creator of [[ASIN:B0000A341P Dark Fall: The Journal]] and [[ASIN:B0002BID5Q Dark Fall: Lights Out]].<br /><br />I had difficulties installing this on my Windows XP laptop; I had to try four or five times, as each time I would begin to install, the installer would launch another copy and freeze completely. My perseverance finally paid off, though, and once I'd launched the game, I didn't encounter any bugs, crashes, or freezes.<br /><br />The game begins with a grainy black-and-white film of you driving along the Cornish country roads as night begins to fall. There is a sense of dread as local radio personality Emma Harry talks about the onset of the Autumn Equinox, and dark clouds race ominously across the sky. Suddenly, your car goes dead, and you're stranded in the middle of a dark forest. But are you alone? There are strange rustles and cries from the bushes, and you're certain that something's watching...<br /><br />Barrow Hill is a first-person slideshow similar to Myst in format. You advance one screen at a time (no 360-degree panning here), which can be terrifying when you're crashing through the undergrowth with only a weak battery flashlight to light the darkness. The photorealistic graphics are based on thousands of pictures of the Cornish countryside. The architecture of the few featured buildings shines, from the ruins of an ancient chapel to the worn-down service station. Little touches make each screen come to life, and there are innumerable close-ups of objects just for exploration's sake (which can be confusing at first trying to determine if it's a hotspot or not). Also like Myst, you'll soon discover that Barrow Hill is devoid of people other than yourself and one or two secondary characters that you interact with only briefly. Where has everyone gone? What happened to the archaeological team? Why are there idling cars with no occupants?<br /><br />The sound deserves special mention, as thousands of ambient sounds were recorded in Cornwall to add to the authenticity, including the chirp of the Cornish cricket.

Voice acting is satisfactory, if a bit melodramatic at times.<br /><br />On your quest, you're aided by several high-tech gadgets, including a cell phone, PDA, GPS, and a metal detector. All of these tools play a part in your quest to restore balance to the barrow.

4.0,"Merely serviceable, but could have been outstanding","Benoit Sokal, the Belgian graphic artist behind Amerzone and Syberia I and II, returns with Paradise courtesy of his new company White Bird Productions.

5.0,Riding the rails to danger...,"Nancy Drew's 13th game finds her full steam ahead in pursuit of the ghostly legend of Jake Hurley. Jake had built a custom train that he and his wife Camille traveled on, but after Camille's mysterious, sudden death aboard the train, Jake, too, disappeared, the train found abandoned with the engineer dead at the wheel. The ""ghost train"" has been restored by socialite Lori Girard, who has invited several celebrities on the maiden voyage: television ghost hunter John Grey, famous historical romance novelist Charleena Purcell, hotshot detective Tino Balducci, Frank and Joe Hardy, and Nancy, of course. Soon after the train heads towards Copper Gorge, Lori disappears and it's up to Nancy to find out what happened to her. Along the way, clues to Camille's untimely death and Jake's legendary mine surface.<br /><br />The modeling of the train cars is a pleasant departure from previous ND games. Scenery whips by outside the train windows, and you have to hop from train car to train car as the ground speeds by underneath. Chandeliers sway from the motion of the train. There is loving attention to detail in each room: period photographs, stitched samplers, and aged sheet music all create a believable atmosphere. In addition to the train, Nancy has the chance to disembark and explore Copper Gorge, Colorado.<br /><br />There are several gameplay additions from previous ND games, including Nancy's camera cell phone and Frank and Joe Hardy (who have a relatively small role, although you do get to play as the Hardy Boys at one point in the game). Puzzles are creative, with some HerInteractive standards such as the ""make your own sandwich"" standby, but others (such as a music-related puzzle) were a welcome breath of fresh air that built on HerInteractive's solid reputation as a producer of non-violent, girl-friendly games that emphasize creative problem solving. Clues are just obvious enough without giving away answers, strategically placed and cleverly hidden.<br /><br />Overall, I thought the ending a bit weak (too many loose ends for my taste), and the much-hyped Hardy Boys underutilized, but the solid gameplay and gorgeous graphics more than make up for it.

4.0,Nancy Drew returns in keen retro style on her twelfth adventure,"Nancy Drew turns 75 this year, and she's still got her youthful sense of sleuthing... in fact, she's as keen as when she first came out in 1930. In honour of Nancy's 75th birthday, Her Interactive has set Nancy's newest mystery ""Secret of the Old Clock"" in 1930s America before the start of the depression. Nancy drives a sporty blue roadster, listens to jazz records, and talks nervously of the possible Depression, while using expressions such as ""keen,"" ""horsefeathers"" and ""the bee's knees."" Nancy's first mystery (based on her first two books Secret of the Old Clock and Mystery at Lilac Inn) finds her investigating mysterious happenings at the Lilac Inn. The inn is run by seventeen-year-old orphaned Emily, whose mother died recently, and her guardian Jane Willoughby, but Emily has asked Nancy to come help her. It turns out that she's been hearing things, and various ""accidents"" have occurred. The plot quickly thickens, leaving Nancy to puzzle out an eccentric millionaire and a forged will that has high stakes for all involved: Jim Archer, banker on the edge of ruin, Richard Topham, ""clairvoyant"" who lives in the deceased millionaire's house, Emily and her guardian.<br /><br />As with previous titles, a good deal of puzzle solving is chore related, of the ""I scratch your back, you scratch mine"" mentality. This means that Nancy must complete chores for other characters before she can receive the necessary information (or inventory) to proceed. Some of these are easier than others: arranging pies, catching a 19-inch largemouth bass, finding toys for a children's orphanage, picking up raffle tickets, and sewing a dress (fiendishly hard, and I'm a cross-stitcher!).<br /><br /> This game sees the addition of two new features, both of which I found unnecessarily frustrating: Nancy's blue roadster, which must be filled up with gas and keeping an eye out for flat tires, and money, which Nancy must spend to solve puzzles (miniature golf, purchasing items, etc.). Nancy's initial $3.50 flies by as you constantly refill your gas tank and spend money to purchase items, and the only way to get more money is by delivering telegrams. This is problematic for two reasons: one, your customers don't tip (although there are some very funny characters and in-jokes), and two, you spend more money in gas delivering them than you earn.<br /><br />That's not to say that ""Secret of the Old Clock doesn't have any redeeming features. Clearly, a great deal of historical research went into the creation of the game, from the 1930s slang to the black-and-white photos that represent Titusville's shops, to the Art Deco motifs in the Lilac Inn and the bank. There seems to be much less interaction with characters: you hardly ever see Emily, chat once or twice with Jane and Topham and Jim Archer. The game seemed shorter (and easier) than other titles in the series, but was a welcome departure in terms of style and feel. A special note here for the game's wonderful atmospheric music: a variety of authentic big band swing with muted horns, mixed with ""creepy"" music at key points, really brings the player into the 1930s. One gripe: the character sprites seemed very low-resolution and blurry, and it wasn't just my monitor. A shame, since so much care was taken on backgrounds and animations.<br /><br />Overall, this is a welcome addition to the Nancy Drew series and another fine accomplishment for Her Interactive, one of the most innovative and dedicated gaming companies around. This will be a hit with Nancy Drew fans, although the addition of driving Nancy's roadster makes navigation extra-difficult for younger players, especially later in the game.

4.0,"Of life, death, and dark desires...","Montreal-based Microids, creator of such gems as Amerzone, Syberia, Road to India and Post Mortem, has created its swan song in the form of Still Life:  Microids was recently absorbed by another Montreal producer, UbiSoft, shortly before the game's launch.  Still Life was chosen as Best Adventure Game at the 2004 E3 convention, and it's easy to see why. Based partially on characters from 2003's Post Mortem (psychic painter/ private eye Gustav McPherson), Still Life tracks the parallels between a modern-day serial killer in Chicago and a similar case in Prague 75 years ago.  Gus McPherson's granddaughter Victoria, or Vic, is a profiler with the FBI and has been assigned to work a case in Chicago involving a series of grisly prostitute murders.<br /><br />The game begins with a stunning, fast-paced cinematic that ties together the modern murders with Gus' case in Prague, awash in sinister mood and a haunting choir soundtrack.  Vic begins at the fifth crime scene, where a prostitute is found stabbed and drowned in a condemned building.  Vic's partner, David Miller, is as green as they come, and instead of helping, ends up contaminating crime scenes with, as Vic dubs them, ""Miller's little Martians,"" aka, vomit.  Vic, with the help of her former Quantico professor/ Chicago coroner Claire, is left to piece together the killer's M.O.  Before long, it becomes clear that the killer is baiting her with clues related to her grandfather's case in Prague.<br /><br />The game is divided into seven chapters, split between Vic (modern Chicago) and Gus (1930s Prague).  Microids previously flirted with the concept in Post Mortem, where several chapters were played by a secondary character.  In Still Life, the convention works well: as Vic reads Gus's journal to gain insights into her current case, the narration dissolves into Gus's world in Prague and his dealings with the local police and the prostitutes that he is hired to protect.<br /><br />The visuals in Still Life build on the gorgeous 2D environments of Syberia and Syberia II, although here they are suitably dark, gritty, and occasionally kinky.  Modern Chicago looks like a slightly sinister Frank Lloyd Wright-designed playground, interjected with grimy, rat-infested buildings, run-down campus apartments, and the sterile, functional police headquarters.  Prague is awash in fog effects, run-down buildings, junkyards, and forbidding sewer tunnels.  The game takes place at night, and even the interiors are dark and edgy.  Artwork plays a huge role in the game, so expect to spend a good amount of time scouring in-game paintings as clues to the killer's motivations and the degree of his twisted sexual fantasies.  Some of Gus's earlier paintings from Post Mortem make appearances here as well.<br /><br />The puzzles in Still Life are generally intuitive, with the exception of two of the hardest puzzles I've ever seen in a game: a torturous lock-picking puzzle in Prague, and an ""escape the lasers"" puzzle in Chicago.  For the most part, puzzles are varied, inventory-based (with the exception of several slider puzzles), and not too difficult.  The Chicago portion of the game is reminiscent of CSI, as Vic uses Luminol, fingerprints, and photographs the crime scenes for analysis.  The game's inventory, however, is not so intuitive, and took a good deal of getting used to.<br /><br />About the rating: rated M for Mature, Still Life seems almost an Adults Only title for its extreme violence, sexual portrayals, and mature subject matter, including graphic language from several characters.  One of the Chicago cops borders on an insulting stereotype as he constantly uses the ""F"" word and other vulgarities.  All of the cops, including Vic and her boss, use the ""F"" expletive with each other, and Vic made one comment so bold that it actually made me uncomfortable.  Although there is no sexual footage outright, there is numerous innuendo, especially in the dialogues of the Prague prostitutes and in the S&M (!) club (Vic makes a comment about ""battery operated boyfriends,"" and is hit on several times by a female S&M employee).<br /><br />The most disappointing aspect is that the game's *very* open ending clearly sets up a sequel, although with Microids being absorbed by UbiSoft, it is doubtful that such a sequel will occur.  One interesting experiment involved an online prelude to Still Life; before the game's launch (and currently the page is still available at [...] ), players got to explore Victoria's background and personal life a bit more in-depth, while introduced to a background of the game's characters and storyline.  The online game involved deciphering codes, finding hidden clues in pictures, and cracking a serial killer's riddles.  Even if the Still Life sequel was executed in a similar fashion, i.e., online, it would provide closure for all the hours of gameplay invested without a final answer as to the mysteries of Still Life.<br /><br />Still Life, although violent, is creepy, beautiful, and artistic.  With believable characters, an edgy soundtrack, gorgeous graphics, and a fast-paced, curveball storyline, Still Life was a joy to play.

The online game involved deciphering codes, finding hidden clues in pictures, and cracking a serial killer's riddles.  Even if the Still Life sequel was executed in a similar fashion, i.e., online, it would provide closure for all the hours of gameplay invested without a final answer as to the mysteries of Still Life.<br /><br />Still Life, although violent, is creepy, beautiful, and artistic.  With believable characters, an edgy soundtrack, gorgeous graphics, and a fast-paced, curveball storyline, Still Life was a joy to play.  I can only hope that one day Microids will complete the trilogy begun by Post Mortem and Still Life.",life death dark desire montrealbased microids creator gem amerzone syberia road india post mortem created swan song form still life microids recently absorbed another montreal producer ubisoft shortly game launch still life chosen best adventure game e convention easy see based partially character post mortem psychic painter private eye gustav mcpherson still life track parallel modernday serial killer chicago similar case prague year ago gu mcpherson granddaughter victoria vic profiler fbi assigned work case chicago involving series grisly prostitute murdersbr br game begin stunning fastpaced cinematic tie together modern murder gu case prague awash sinister mood haunting choir soundtrack vic begin fifth crime scene prostitute found stabbed drowned condemned building vics partner david miller green come instead helping end contaminating crime scene vic dub miller little martian aka vomit vic help former quantico professor chicago coroner claire left piece together killer mo long becomes clear killer baiting clue related grandfather case praguebr br game divided seven chapter split vic modern chicago gu prague microids previously flirted concept post mortem several chapter played secondary character still life convention work well vic read guss journal gain insight current case narration dissolve guss world prague dealing local police prostitute hired protectbr br visuals still life build gorgeous environment syberia syberia ii although suitably dark gritty occasionally kinky modern chicago look like slightly sinister frank lloyd wrightdesigned playground interjected grimy ratinfested building rundown campus apartment sterile functional police headquarters prague awash fog effect rundown building junkyard forbidding sewer tunnel game take place night even interior dark edgy artwork play huge role game expect spend good amount time scouring ingame painting clue killer motivation degree twisted sexual fantasy guss earlier painting post mortem make appearance wellbr br puzzle still life generally intuitive exception two hardest puzzle ive ever seen game torturous lockpicking puzzle prague escape laser puzzle chicago part puzzle varied inventorybased exception several slider puzzle difficult chicago portion game reminiscent csi vic us luminol fingerprint photograph crime scene analysis game inventory however intuitive took good deal getting used tobr br rating rated mature still life seems almost adult title extreme violence sexual portrayal mature subject matter including graphic language several character one chicago cop border insulting stereotype constantly us f word vulgarity cop including vic bos use f expletive vic made one comment bold actually made uncomfortable although sexual footage outright numerous innuendo especially dialogue prague prostitute sm club vic make comment battery operated boyfriend hit several time female sm employeebr br disappointing aspect game open ending clearly set sequel although microids absorbed ubisoft doubtful sequel occur one interesting experiment involved online prelude still life game launch currently page still available player got explore victoria background personal life bit indepth introduced background game character storyline online game involved deciphering code finding hidden clue picture cracking serial killer riddle even still life sequel executed similar fashion ie online would provide closure hour gameplay invested without final answer mystery still lifebr br still life although violent creepy beautiful artistic believable character edgy soundtrack gorgeous graphic fastpaced curveball storyline still life joy play hope one day microids complete trilogy begun post mortem still life
5.0,"A gritty, edgy homage to Kafka and Lynch that still packs a wallop 10 years later!","Pulse Entertainment's Bad Mojo was originally released in 1995 to rave reviews.  This gritty tale of betrayal and dark secrets was based in part upon Franz Kafka's ""Metamorphosis"" and the styling of David Lynch. The protagonist is Roger Samms, a nerdy entomologist bent on revenge who is mysteriously transformed into a cockroach.<br /><br />Roger lives in a seedy waterfront dive in San Francisco, and you play Roger (in roach form) as he scurries and scuttles through the various rooms.  You can only access one room at a time, and each area reveals clues to Roger's past in the form of interactive photos, flashback movies, and riddles delivered by an oracle.  Although the game is over 10 years old, the visuals, sound, effects and level of detail is still amazing.  The original miniature FMV videos are remastered and now nearly full screen, and instead of the original 256 colors, the rerelease runs in true color.<br /><br />You must avoid ordinary objects that mean death to roaches: oil spills, wet paint, gas burners, and other animals: spiders, cats and rats intent on having you as their next meal.  Along the way, other insects and animals will give you hints on how to solve the many puzzles integrated into the gaming environment.<br /><br />Although ""Bad Mojo"" is only rated T for Teen, the game contains numerous gross-outs by design, and is not for the squeamish.  Rotting food, maggot-infested raw meat, sewage, and bloody fish and rats are shown in all their full-screen, photorealistic glory (or is that gory?).  They do add to the atmosphere of the dark, seedy world of Eddie's Bar, but consider yourself forewarned if the sight of moldy TV dinners, filthy toilets and roach-infested buildings send you into spasms.<br /><br />An added bonus is the included DVD that features an in-depth ""Making of Bad Mojo,"" featuring detailed interviews with many of the game's designers, artists and producers, footage from filming the game's videos, concept art, storyboards and video hints to each level.<br /><br />An absolute gem with a unique premise, addictive gameplay and an unusual storyline (to say the least), this ""Bad Mojo"" rerelease is a perfect holiday gift from Pulse Entertainment, since the original version from 1995 is out-of-print and won't run on Windows 98 or higher.

5.0,George and Nico are back in style!,"The first instalment in the Broken Sword series (1996's Shadow of the Templars, US title Circle Of Blood) introduced us to American-in-Paris tourist George Stobbart, the glamorous Parisian photographer Nicole ""Nico"" Collard, the lecherous museum curator Andr&eacute; Lobineau, and a host of other delightful (and dastardly) secondary characters. With hand-painted cels by former Don Bluth animators, the game had a revolutionary look and feel--it was like being immersed in an interactive animated movie.  BS: SotT's witty dialogue, excellent soundtrack, and well-integrated puzzles made it an instant classic.  The sequel, Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror was released in 1997.<br /><br />Seven years later, creator Charles Cecil has resurrected George and Nico once more so that they may save the world in style, this time from the evil plans of Se&ntilde;or Susarro, who plans on harnessing the Earth's energy in order to make himself an all-powerful immortal.<br /><br />The first part of the game cuts between the respective action in Paris and the Congo.  Nico is framed for murder and must prove her innocence, and George must discover Chomondely's secret deep in the jungle.  Their stories converge in an action-packed fashion (would we have it any other way?).  One of the highlights of the game is the ability to play as both George and Nico.<br /><br />The major difference in Sleeping Dragon is that the series has gone to a 3D prerendered platform in place of 2D painted cells.  Another development is the absence of the mouse (Cecil dug an early grave with adventure gamers by claiming that ""point and click"" was dead)-the controls are the A,S,D, W and directional keys, which takes some getting used to. The constantly changing camera angles are annoying at best and fatal at worst, as several scenes involve timed escapes. I also encountered several bugs, the most annoying of which involved characters pausing during dialogues, and then speaking two or three lines at the same time.<br /><br />Sleeping Dragon is much more action-based than its predecessors, so expect to shimmy across narrow outcroppings, inch along precarious ledges by your fingertips, leap across chasms, sneak past guards and have the occasional fight sequence.<br /><br />There are a variety of puzzle types incorporated into the game, most of moderate difficulty. Puzzles can be solved by examining the inventory, combining objects and going through all dialogue options. One glaring pet peeve: the sheer abundance of Sobokan ""move this crate over there"" type puzzles, which numbered at least two dozen. The first few times were exciting, but I would see another crate, block, appliance, etc. and groan. Next time, less boxes, guys.<br /><br />The graphics are gorgeous, the voice acting is top notch (a rarity), the music is worthy of John Williams, the one-liners fast and furious, and the storyline is a novel unto itself.

5.0,Syberia II a stunning completion of Kate and Hans� journey.,"Montréal-based Microïds and artist Benoît Sokal have teamed up once again to bring us the final chapter to Syberia, a mythical island where mammoths still roam.  In 2002's Syberia (rated Game of the Year), promising New York lawyer Kate Walker traveled to France to oversee a simple factory buyout. The factory owner, Anna Voralberg, had died, and left a mysterious heir--her brain-damaged brother, Hans, who was somewhere deep in the Russian tundra. Kate journeyed across a Europe recovering from the scars of Communism in order to find the heir and be done with it, but along the way she began to care about Hans and his fantastic mechanical creations. The first Syberia ended with Kate jumping aboard the train in Aralbad, leaving her past and journeying towards an unknown future in Hans' quest to reach Syberia.<br />Syberia II picks up at that exact point, with Kate and Hans rocketing along in the snowy wilderness towards Syberia. As in the previous game, there are four worlds to discover: the gloomy border town of Romansbourg, the vast Great North Passage, the Youkol Village and the Last Voyage. Kate revisits Valadilene, Hans' birthplace, in a sepia-toned dream sequence (the haunting music here sounds as if it was composed by Danny Elfman, i.e. haunting chimes, bells and soloists).<br />In addition to Kate, Hans and Oscar (the cowardly automaton train driver), several characters from the first game have cameos here as well. There are multiple new characters to aid Kate on her quest: the spunky orphan Malka, Colonel Emeliov Goupatchev, bartender and surrogate parent Cirkos, a Youkol chief and shaman. There are enemies that threaten to end Kate's quest: the stern Orthodox Patriarch and bumbling villains Igor and Ivan. Animal characters also play an important role in Syberia II: the spirit guardian Harfang, lemmings, man-eating penguins (!), ferocious grizzly bears, and a Youki, a loyal dog-seal hybrid bred by the Youkol people.<br />There are several notable improvements from the first game, including major graphics improvements: reflections in water and glass, ice textures, and uniform fabric and decals; real time snowfall and footstep marks; dynamic lighting and shadows; animated fog; and better in-game animation. The cutscenes are gorgeous and numerous, and can be replayed at any point. The music is as immersive and beautiful as in the first game, and cycles in and out of gameplay. For much of the time the only sounds are of Kate's footsteps, snow gently thudding off branches and roofs, and nature sounds (birds, wind, wolves howling, ice cracking).<br />The puzzles are more organic in nature than the first game and there is more of an action element: Kate must rock climb, scale antennae towers, swing across chasms and outwit attackers (human and animal). An interesting (but unnecessary) subplot involves a detective hired by her employer to hunt Kate down and bring her home. Kate's cell phone, a crucial element in the first Syberia, has several brief appearances, but Kate generally hangs up mid-call (If I were her I would have thrown it off the train!).<br />Syberia II has much more of a spiritual element based on Youkol medicine and shamanism (you must make a Youkol potion, summon a spirit guide, and journey into a spirit world), and the ending ties up storylines from both games. There are several tear-jerker moments in the game.<br />There are optional subtitles for the hearing-impaired, a ""Syberia recap"" that neatly packages the major events of the first game into an entertaining trailer for those not familiar with the Syberia universe, and replay option for cinematic cutscenes. Syberia II is visually stunning, thought-provoking and a more than satisfying sequel that lives up to the impossibly high standards of the first Syberia.

5.0,Nancy makes a splash in the Pacific Northwest!!,"Teenage sleuth Nancy Drew is back and better than ever in her latest case, �Danger on Deception Island.� This time around Nancy is visiting marine biologist Katie Firestone at her friends� request, but things go wrong as usual. Shortly after Ms. Drew�s arrival at to the San Juan Islands, Katie discovers that her whale watching boat has been vandalized. While Katie makes everything shipshape, Nancy is hot on the trail of the vandals, along with investigating recent burglaries, digging up Snake Horse Harbor�s past and making friends with a local legend.<br />Besides Katie, Nancy meets Holt Scotto, fisherman and harbormaster candidate, Jenna Deblin, owner of the Hot Kettle Café, and Andy Jason, who runs a rival whale watching business and wants to buy Katie out. Add to that strange fish that have been washing up on shore, a string of burglaries, and an eccentric widow who launches messages in bottles into the harbour.<br /> �Danger on Deception Island� is the most organic and satisfying of the nine current Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive. Several new additions include bicycling (similar to the motorboat interface used in �Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake�) and kayaking, WWW access from Nancy�s trusty laptop and more. The puzzles were excellently integrated into the gaming environment, making use of the Pacific Northwest�s charms: building sand castles, kayaking sea caves, bicycling the winding coastal roads, exploring a lighthouse, and digging for clams on deserted beaches. Nancy must also help Katie restore her boat to working order. There are several fun activities not necessary to win the game, including fixing sandwiches with some not-so-tasty ingredients (jellyfish, Tabasco sauce, expired mayonnaise, baking soda), building sand castles, and educational games about whales.<br />As usual, there are two levels of difficulty, Junior and Senior Detective, and there are plenty of hints and help scattered along the way for both levels, including calling the Hardy Boys for tips and clues. There are many educational elements in �Deception Island,� including informative �webpages� about nautical terms, wood identification, Morse code, various types of whales and more that are necessary to solve the mysteries. Graphics are gorgeous (including photo overlays during the biking scenes), character modeling is lifelike, music includes rousing sea chanteys and ominous strings reminiscent of �Jaws,� and voice acting is above average. Sound effects make you feel like you�re really standing on a lonely, windswept shore with only the breaking waves and cries of the gulls to keep you company.

4.0,"""Haunted Carousel"" an entertaning ride.","In ""The Haunted Carousel,"" teenage sleuth Nancy Drew is on her eighth case: investigating amusement park ""hauntings"" in Captains Cove, NJ.

5.0,&iexcl;Bienvenido al mundo de los maya!,"I have played all the Nancy Drew titles from Her Interactive, and Secret of the Scarlet Hand (based on Nancy Drew book 125) is the best (and most impressive) of the lot. In this adventure Nancy is the new deputy curator at Beech Hill Museum in Washington D.C. The museum is almost ready to open its most impressive exhibit: a large collection of priceless Maya artifacts on loan from the Mexican government and private collectors. But shortly before the opening, one of the prized jade carvings is stolen from under Nancy's nose. The only clue is a vivid red handprint and a message in Maya glyphs left by the thief.<br />First, let me say that, as someone who is seriously considering a master's degree in museum studies, this game was an absolute delight! The museum is filled with nooks and crannies to explore: the curator's office, the exhibition hall, a three-storey Maya temple, gardens, shipping and receiving and the lab, filled with neat gadgets such as an analyzer, foam packing machine, ham radio and more, all of which help Nancy on her quest.<br />""Secret of the Scarlet Hand"" simply offers more locations than previous games, more characters/suspects, and a much deeper storyline. Nancy travels to different locations by subway, with a static image overlay as the various station lights light up on the metro map. Graphics are, as always, beautiful. The Maya artifacts are photo realistic, extremely detailed and vibrant. Music and ambient sounds are more pronounced than in previous ND games. The score features haunting panpipes, rainforest birdcalls, and flamenco, along with more ominous mood music-although some reviewers though the music was too repetitive, I found that the soundtrack greatly enhanced the gaming experience.<br />This is definitely the most educational of the Nancy Drew games. Players must write down references to Mayan language, religion, rulers and more since there are three temple quizzes that Nancy must pass to progress in the game. Since it is set in a museum, the educational elements fit right into the game world without seeming out of place. ""Scarlet Hand"" is also the most difficult of the ND games to date, relying on a great deal of snooping, reading, Morse code transmissions in Spanish, telephone calls, and beating puzzles to progress in the investigation, but the great story and characters make it worth it.  Parents may find themselves roped into aiding investigations and end up playing the game themselves-there is plenty of variety in the various puzzles and tasks to keep the game interesting. Once again, Her Interactive has provided young girls with a positive, nonviolent role model in Nancy, and ""Scarlet Hand"" will be sure to thrill Nancy Drew/mystery fans, museum fans, and anyone looking for an engaging cultural journey.

4.0,"�Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake� a spooky tale of dogs,gold,+ greed","""Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake"" is the seventh Nancy Drew game from Her Interactive. This time around Nancy is visiting family friend Sally McDonald at her new cabin in Ghost Lake, Pennsylvania, once home to notorious 1920s gangster Mickey Mallone. Sally has fled in fear, and when Nancy arrives she finds herself trapped at the cabin due to a fallen tree. Sally hurriedly calls her from her cell phone, warning her about the ""ghost dogs."" Soon after, Nancy sees them for herself: four snarling, lunging Rottweilers with glowing teeth and eyes attack the cabin, rattling the doors and throwing themselves at the house.<br />Nancy decides to stay and get to the bottom of her latest mystery: ghost dogs or flesh-and-blood ones? There are three suspects: Emily Griffen, owner of Em's Emporium (Moon Lake's general store), Jeff Akers, park ranger, and Red Knott, retired birdwatcher. All three have some direct connection to the reason behind the ""hauntings,"" and the main motive is the rumoured cache of stolen gold that Mickey Mallone stashed somewhere near the cabin before being hauled off to jail (where he died). Nancy must navigate through a maze of woods to find the cemetery behind the cabin in order to search for clues, as well as interrogating suspects, snooping through secret passageways, and escaping danger.<br />As in all Nancy Drew games, Nancy can die in a number of ways if she's not careful. This time possible deaths include a motorboat explosion, falling through rotten floorboards, falling down a hole in the dark, being clubbed with a human bone, being tied up and left in a burning shed, and being drowned, so be careful and save often!<br />""GDoML"" features beautiful graphics of various locations to explore: Mallone's cabin, the woods, several locations on Moon Lake, a cemetery, an underground network of passageways, and a speakeasy. Playing as a Senior Detective, I found that the difficulty level was just about right, however, the woods maze drove me crazy and I had to go online to print off a decent map (the one included in the game didn't help me much). That was by far the most challenging part of the game, since Nancy has to go into the woods a number of times to search for clues, birds, bugs and more. Every screenshot looked the same, and the map had to be brought up each time, with no way to mark Nancy's progress onscreen.<br />One nifty feature was Nancy's PDA, which automatically records clues, phone numbers, and hints. You can also call Sally, a mystery woman connected to the case, and George and Bess if you need clues. Most of the puzzles were of two types: numeric/dials/switches or tasks. There are several dial puzzles, a letter block puzzle, a valve puzzle, and a safe combination to crack. The other three characters will assign Nancy tasks in return for necessary items such as batteries, camouflage gear, sandpaper and a spark plug, including stacking cola cans, finding bait in the woods, taking pictures of birds with a digital camera, and organizing file folders by Roman numerals. Nancy also performs tasks for Sally, such as testing the well water and repairing rotten floorboards. The puzzles in this game seem much more natural and integrated into the gaming environment than in some previous Nancy Drew games. As with previous Nancy Drew games, there is an ""alarm clock"" setting to change from day to night since some tasks (and events) can only be completed then.<br />Graphics were above average and voice work and sounds were above average as well. The ambient nature sounds were very well done (the forest sounds different between day and night, insects droning, individual bird calls, creaking wooden doors and stairs, the ghost dogs). The music was not memorable other than building tension in certain key scenes. The interface is simple: all actions are accomplished with the left mouse button. You can pan around some screens, making it closer to 360º rather than a static environment, but overall the Nancy Drew games are still in a slideshow format. One improvement is characters: in earlier games characters would only have one or two movements and repeat them while talking to Nancy, and the lip-synching was really bad. In ""GDoML,"" at least one character moves very articulately and randomly and characters lip synch much more realistically. The attention to detail makes this game educational as well as fun: in the ranger station there is a computer with files on local wildlife, park regulations, and the history of Moon Lake. Nancy will do a good deal of reading old newspaper clippings and journals. Nearly everything is subtitled for hearing-impaired players (a very nice touch), including sounds, dialogue and cutscenes. One last feature that I appreciated was the short promos for the other six Nancy Drew games in the series and a trailer for the next Nancy Drew game ""The Haunted Carousel.""

3.0,"""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" promising, but with flaws","""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" was my fourth Nancy Drew game and my favourite so far. Out of the four games I've played (""Final Scene,"" ""Secrets Can Kill,"" ""Message in a Haunted Mansion, ""Treasure in the Royal Tower""), ""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" had the most satisfying plot, interesting characters, clever dialogue, and the most cool places to explore.<br />Nancy is on vacation at a ski resort in Wisconsin built by an eccentric millionaire. The resort is built to look like a castle, complete with a tower that was imported from a chateau in France. French queen Marie Antoinette used to spend a good deal of time in the tower, and one of the hotel guests believes that the tower holds an important secret that could clear Marie Antoinette's name. When you arrive, a killer blizzard leaves everyone trapped in the castle, and the castle's library has been vandalized. Besides yourself, there are a number of suspects: Jacques, the Olympic ski instructor, Lisa, the photojournalist, Dexter, the caretaker, and Mrs. Hotchkiss, the eccentric Marie Antoinette scholar. As the game progresses you will learn a great deal about French Revolutionary history and Marie Antoinette in particular.<br />The locations in the game are varied and realistic: an imposing lobby, a comfy lounge with a blazing fireplace, the ransacked library, Nancy's room, castle corridors that lead to dead ends, twisty stone stairwells, an antique elevator, a shed, a secret garden and the Royal Tower. Along the way you'll slip along secret passageways, climb elevator shafts, and ascend into the Royal Tower to find Marie Antoinette's secret, but...BE CAREFUL. Someone doesn't want you to succeed in your search: you are deliberately trapped in the elevator, hit over the head, and locked outside to freeze to death. Only your quick thinking and detective skills can save Nancy!<br />Buyer Beware:<br />I *loved * this game, but I have to give it only three stars because I had HORRIBLE problems getting the game to run. It would crash constantly in the middle of conversations or leave me stuck at a certain point in a hallway before giving me an error message of ""Invalid CHUNK file."" I had to restart the game 25-30 times before I could beat it, and it would cause my computer to crash as well.There is no patch available on HerInteractive's website. I changed a number of settings and configurations and the problem didn't go away. The most frustrating thing was that it wouldn't let me beat the game: after the villain revealed their identity, a chase scene was supposed to follow, but the computer would never return control to me and the baddie got away every time.

4.0,"Fun, but confusing","""Message in a Haunted Mansion"" was my second Nancy Drew game (my first was ""The Final Scene."") The graphics are beautiful, with numerous little details that really made the Victorian mansion come alive. Nancy is staying with a friend and helping her fix up a Victorian mansion that she is going to turn into a B&B, except strange accidents keep happening that delay the grand opening. Is the house really haunted?<br />The only problem I encountered was that I must have played out of order, because I kept finding clues and I had no idea what they were related to. The story seemed disjointed and not as in-depth as with ""Treasure in the Royal Tower."" But I really enjoyed the bandit/Chinese subplot, the séance, and the many puzzles. The sound effects were genuinely creepy: one minute you will be walking down the hallway and the sound of a woman crying comes from nowhere. Or you're walking up a deserted staircase and you hear ghostly whispers.<br />There are two levels, junior and senior detective. The puzzles are slightly harder for senior detectives, but the plot is the same. If you get stuck you can call your friends Bess and George for hints. I needed to look online for hints quite a bit since, as I said earlier, I must have missed clues since large parts of the story were missing for me.<br />One of the things that bugged me was the fact that there really weren't many places to explore.

The graphics are beautiful, with numerous little details that really made the Victorian mansion come alive. Nancy is staying with a friend and helping her fix up a Victorian mansion that she is going to turn into a B&B, except strange accidents keep happening that delay the grand opening. Is the house really haunted?<br />The only problem I encountered was that I must have played out of order, because I kept finding clues and I had no idea what they were related to. The story seemed disjointed and not as in-depth as with ""Treasure in the Royal Tower."" But I really enjoyed the bandit/Chinese subplot, the séance, and the many puzzles. The sound effects were genuinely creepy: one minute you will be walking down the hallway and the sound of a woman crying comes from nowhere. Or you're walking up a deserted staircase and you hear ghostly whispers.<br />There are two levels, junior and senior detective. The puzzles are slightly harder for senior detectives, but the plot is the same. If you get stuck you can call your friends Bess and George for hints. I needed to look online for hints quite a bit since, as I said earlier, I must have missed clues since large parts of the story were missing for me.<br />One of the things that bugged me was the fact that there really weren't many places to explore.

5.0,"MacPherson, ma'am. Gus MacPherson. Welcome to the Dark Side.","As any reviewer will tell you, writing reviews is a very personal experience. I was one of the few that found Microïds' ""Road to India"" to be an imaginative and overall pleasing little game (emphasis on little, since it took less than four hours to play through...a crime for the money invested).  Other reviews from online gaming magazines backed me up, giving ""RtI"" scores of 80% and up. However, *ever other Amazon.com reviewer* gave the game two stars or less, and I felt positively guilty that some who read my glowing, five-star review had purchased the game and hated it based solely on my opinion. So, for Microïds' ""Post Mortem "" (distributed in North America by Dreamcatcher Games)  I am trying a new technique: besides my own observations, I'm going to list the review scores from a number of sites that I regularly use to preview and purchase computer games.<br />""Post Mortem"" is Montréal-based Microïds' newest offering, a grisly tale of murder, betrayal, lust and dark, dark secrets. Let me stress the word dark. This IS NOT a game for sensitive viewers, as there are a number of violent and disturbing images during the course of the game. The visuals themselves are dark and dreary nighttime views of Paris, with a moody jazz soundtrack. The interface is similar to ""Road to India,"" with (occasionally grainy) 360-degree panning. The inventory is a bit tricky to navigate, and the dialogue is easily the weakest point in the game (as well as some of the voice acting). Although there are various responses that can be chosen for a given question, you must eventually choose nearly all the responses before continuing. Nor is there any way to skip through dialogue, which can be a boring pain after the second or third time, which diminishes replay value drastically. Some of the puzzles were trial and error, others were too easy and practically shouted out the answer for themselves (another flaw with Microïds' ""Road to India"" was that the puzzles were waaay too easy (but I still stand by my five-star rating for originality and beautiful visuals, as well as exploring a new country and culture, very much like ""Post Mortem"").<br />The game's psychic premise could have been further explored: you play Gustave MacPherson, an American private investigator living in Paris. Even as a child, you were ""sensitive"" and able to sense and see events, which you explore in your paintings. A beautiful and mysterious woman knocks on the door of your shabby flat and wants you to investigate the murder of her sister and brother-in-law in a posh Paris hotel. The story soon takes an occult twist, leaving McPherson to rely both on good old detective work (including an identity sketch puzzle) and his psychic instincts (mostly used as an excuse to show violent, gruesome flashbacks). As I said earlier, the psychic angle could have been further explored, allowing the player to interact with other characters or sites with McPherson's ability.<br />The game lets you explore 1920's Paris by night, a visual and aural treat never before seen in a game. You visit exotic locations and interview shady characters, all of which have secrets of their own. The psychic approach is a novel idea as well. The game is short, although much longer than ""Road to India,"" offering 15+ hours of gameplay.<br />Why I am awarding ""Post Mortem"" five stars:<br />The Good:<br />+ The graphics. Microïds always makes graphics a strong point, as in ""Amerzone,"" ""Road to India,"" the unparalleled ""Syberia"" and now ""Post Mortem."" The freedom of movement with 360° panning really lets you feel as if you were in Paris, rather than watching a slideshow of it à la Myst. Characters are very lifelike and expressive, although synching may be off<br />+ The story: although the Templars have been dealt with in other games (""Gabriel Knight III""), ""Post Mortem"" makes an effort not to follow in the footsteps of past games with the same subject matter.

5.0,"Lotus Spring, how does your garden grow?","""The Legend of Lotus Spring"" is the first game from Women Wise, a feminist group dedicated to producing quality games that appeal to a female gaming audience. ""Lotus Spring"" is more of an interactive exploration than a game per se: there are really no puzzles, no mazes, and no missions other than exploring the now-extinct Garden of Perfect Brightness in 19th century China. You play as Emperor Xian Feng and are searching for your love, the concubine HeHanQu, who, as a Han woman, was forbidden from marrying the Emperor, and the jealousy of the Dowager Empress CiXi proves formidable as she sends HeHanQu, or Lotus Spring, to an island in the middle of the garden. But Lotus Spring has disappeared and now you must find her....<br />""Lotus Spring"" is filled with history and touches of now-vanished imperial China under the Qing dynasty. As you explore the many sights and locations in the Garden of Perfect Brightness you will stumble upon shared moments between the Emperor and Lotus Spring, many of which are poignant.

5.0,"A visually stunning, immersive gameworld unlike any other...","I eagerly snatched up a copy of French cartoonist Benoît Sokal's ""Amerzone"" a few years ago, an obscure little game with gorgeous graphics and creative critters. I dearly loved ""Amerzone"" because it was unique: following the legacy of a dying explorer to a remote South American country isn't your standard game fare. The problem with ""Amerzone"" was that the game was too short, too easy and there was hardly any music or character interaction. With ""Syberia,"" which was originally intended to be an Amerzone sequel of sorts, many of the problems with ""Amerzone"" have been fixed outright.<br />In ""Syberia"" you play the role of an up-and-coming New York lawyer, Kate Walker, sent to buy out a French toy factory in the Alps. But when Kate arrives in Valadilene, she finds that closing the deal won't be as simple as she thought as Miss Anna, the owner of the factory, has died, and there is a mysterious heir. Kate must journey across countries searching for his identity. Along the way, she rediscovers herself, becoming more assured and independent, a true adventurer.<br />""Syberia"" indulges in flights of fancy unlike anything I've ever experienced. The plot was a masterpiece of mystery, drama, melodramatic moments, and half-buried family secrets. The graphics are photorealistic, and the animations are some of the best that I've ever seen. The music is lush and haunting, always reflecting the particular country/atmosphere that it was portraying. Words cannot do this fantastic game justice. Play it for yourself, then keep an eye out for the sequel, which is due Fall 2003.<br />Microids is the same company that produced the love-it-or-hate-it ""Road to India."" Based on every other Amazon.com review except mine, everyone hated it. I loved it, flaws and all, and I think that for a small company in Montr&eacute;al with a smallish budget, Microids did a fantastic job trying to capture the feel of India and come up with a semi-original mystery. It is much easier to critique what a game is missing or lacking than to sit down and produce a game from start to finish, sticking to the plot, deadlines and budget. However, ""Syberia"" is a superior game in every way: the 3D models, voice actors, animations, and the biggest difference is storyline. Where ""Road to India"" lacked much of a plot, ""Syberia"" has a novel-length backstory and plenty of twists and turns.<br />The Good: Everything<br />+ 3D models are extremely realistic, especially in closeup (think Helena Romanski's opera performance---the most haunting thing I will EVER see in a video game OR movie)<br />+ Architecture uses elements from Art Nouveau, Russian Communist-era factories, dilapidated, once elegant seaside resorts, train station/greenhouses...<br />+ Voice acting is superb, especially the cell phone conversations<br />+ Cell phone added a level of real-world plausibility: having Kate's boss calling and nagging you, having to listen to Kate's mom gush about her new boyfriend, talking with your boyfriend, your best friend sharing secrets along with her finds at Bloomingdales...you also use the phone in at least one puzzle to gather information. All together a nice touch.<br />+ Music (haunting, magical and highly addictive)<br />+ Cutscenes played like movies. The flashbacks to WWII were especially well done, as was the intro and the ending (which I found to be magnificent...although the actual end of the game does come very abruptly).<br />+ Characters: Unlike ""Amerzone"" and ""Road to India,"" where there was hardly a soul, in ""Syberia"" there are dozens of characters that you interact with on your journey, all of them interesting and some with quite the personality!<br />+ Story: Highly original, magical, with unexpected twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my office chair<br />+ Creatures: some of the creatures from ""Amerzone"" make a guest appearance, and you will learn quite a bit about mammoths.<br />+ Attending a lecture at Barrockstadt University<br />+ The evolution of Kate Walker's character from a business-minded, uptight lawyer, to an adventurer who comes to care for the company she was going to sell<br />The not-so-good (with this game I can't make myself say ""bad""):<br />- Occasional crashes<br />- Ending is very abrupt (not the ending cutscene, but simply the ending itself...quite obviously a setup for a sequel and rather a disappointment after all the puzzle-solving<br />- Many puzzles are easy, especially to seasoned gamers<br />- Kate's annoying ""No need to go down there"" and ""No point.

5.0,"Top-notch sequel in ""Escape From Monkey Island""","""Escape from Monkey Island"" is the fourth game in the ""Monkey Island"" series, which follow the adventures of wannabe pirate Guybrush Threepwood and the love of his life, Governor Elaine Marley, as they battle against the evil undead pirate Chuck LeChuck (who just won't stay dead after three games). In ""Escape from Monkey Island"" Guybrush returns from his honeymoon with Elaine to find out that they have been declared dead. Now he must investigate a slimy Australian developer who is buying up all of the Tri-Island area and ""reforming"" the pirates into docile citizens. In the meantime Elaine is running for governor against Charles L. Charles, a suspiciously familiar face. Once again Guybrush gets to rescue the damsel in distress, fight monkeys in Monkey Kombat (a hilarious Mortal Kombat spoof you have to see to believe), and test his wit at Insult Arm Wrestling, as well as downing Groggoccinos from Starbuccaneers and visiting his own theme restaurant Planet Threepwood (sound familiar?), all while trying to find a powerful Voodoo charm, the Ultimate Insult, before the bad guys do.<br />""EFMI"" is the first game to feature 3D characters, and all of the familiar faces (Guybrush, Elaine, Carla, Otis, Herman) translate well to their new medium. The game's engine is basically an upgraded Grim Fandango GRIME system, but the graphics are gorgeous (and eccentric: the familiar swirly clouds, watercolour stars, nifty maps and gaudy costumes look great). The music is a mysterious blend of Caribbean and sweeping scores worthy of John Williams (steel drums, rowdy pirate music, Muzak in Starbuccaneers and Jambalaya Island (the same theme changes to a minor key once you visit Nuttin Atoll, nice touch) string-driven themes). The voice acting is superb, with Dominic Armato returning as Guybrush, Charity James as Elaine, Earl Boen as LeChuck, Tom Kane (Darwin on ""The Wild Thornberries""), and Nick Tate as Ozzie. The dialogue is as sharp as any of the previous games (I loved listening to Ozzie Mandrill spouting Australian insults and throwing around Aussie slang at every opportunity), and the storyline is always a surprise. I had a few small technical problems even after installing the patch, but I found workarounds, and other than that the game ran great (it does require 3D acceleration, however).

5.0,�The Final Scene� a gripping thriller�,"""Nancy Drew: The Final Scene"" is the first Nancy Drew game I've had the pleasure to play. After reading so many positive reviews from Amazon.com customers and game magazines alike, I decided that I had to try it for myself. The main attraction of the game for me was the thought of exploring a (dilapidated) vaudeville theatre, a (virtual) pastime of mine.<br />""The Final Scene"" bears many similarities to one of my all-time favourite games, 1994's ""Are You Afraid Of The Dark: The Tale of Orpheo's Curse."" Produced by now-extinct Viacom NewMedia, ""The Tale of Orpheo's Curse"" also took place in a condemned vaudeville theatre built in the early 1900s. Both ""Orpheo's Curse"" and ""The Final Scene"" draw heavily on magic tricks and lore. Both theatres are full of faded splendour and faded memories: black-and-white photos of visiting performers, elegant, now-tattered wallpaper, and secret passageways galore.<br />""The Final Scene"" is gorgeous. Intricate attention to detail, such as spilled popcorn, the texture of a canvas backdrop, and plaster moldings in the lobby really capture the feel of the once-elegant (and fictious) Royal Palladium. Character models are realistic, with good lip-sync and facial expressions. Voice acting is above-average, and the music and sound effects really lend the game a spooky atmosphere: slow, sultry jazz trumpets, creepy organ music, ghostly laughter.<br />The game offers two levels of difficulty: Junior Detective and Senior Detective. The storyline is the same for both games, only the puzzles are harder as a Senior Dective. There is a nifty ""Second Chance"" feature that allows you to start over at the precise moment before you ""died."" And yes, there are a number of possible deaths facing Nancy if she doesn't solve the mystery or watch her step, including electrocution, a falling box, a falling spotlight, and most terrifying of all, a wrecking ball.<br />Detectives have to carefully gather clues and interrogate suspects. There are four in ""The Final Scene"" :  Joseph Hughes, elderly caretaker of the theatre, Nicholas Falcone, activist with a criminal past, Simone Mueller, power-hungry agent, and Brady Armstrong, teenage heartthrob movie star. Nothing is as it seems, and everyone has some personal involvement in the Royal Palladium.<br />The game begins with Nancy and her friend Maya Nguyen, a student reporter, at the Royal Palladium for the premiere of Brady Armstrong's latest film, ""Vanishing Destiny."" An appropriate title as it turns out, for Maya vanishes from Brady's (empty) dressing room as Nancy stands outside, helpless.<br />There are plenty of delicious twists and turns, and like Fox Mulder from the X-Files, you must ""trust no one."" Nancy has three days to track down Maya and her kidnapper before the building is demolished. This includes snooping through personal belongings, making phone calls, and exploring hidden passageways. Nancy also gets to play with some fun equipment. There is plenty of humour, most of it sarcastic on Nancy's part.  ""What's the requests?"" asks Nicholas Falcone, to which Nancy answers, ""Don't you mean...what *are * the requests?"" ""What are you, my freshman English teacher?"" he snaps back,  then asks again, ""What's the requests?""<br />The side characters are just as memorable, including a spunky 96-year-old Russian woman, Eustacia, with her cat food coupons, who tells Nancy to save her gratitude ""for my funeral.""

As if that wasn't enough, the game has a scavenger hunt and a trivia game as well.<br />There are three different types of riding challenges: dressage, cross country and show jumping. There are four skill levels based on accumulated points (earned by completing the scavenger hunt, correct trivia answers, caring for and riding your horse.

The four horses each have different strengths and personalities and respond a bit differently to each jump. There's even a commentator for all three challenges.

4.0,Gabriel Knight III an interesting mystery....,"This is the first ""Gabriel Knight"" game that I've played, and I'm definitely looking forward to playing more games in the series.

4.0,"An entertaining, frequently macabre Druidic mystery","After waiting for more than five months after its release in North America, I finally purchased ""Mystery of the Druids."" I had read a number of negative reviews involving gameplay, bugs, and frequent system glitches, all of which caused me to wait a while before rushing out to buy a copy. But I had no problems installing or running the game on my computer, and was generally impressed with this mystery/thriller from German publishers CDV and House of Tales.<br />This was a labour of love for a small handful of programmers, and as such is not a totally polished, flawless game, but it has its bright points along with its flaws.<br />You play the roles of Detective Brent Halligan of Scotland Yard and Melanie Turner, an anthropologist at the Oxford Museum of Anthropology. Together you explore a string of gruesome murders in London known as the Skeleton Murders, for that is all that is found of the victims. Halligan suspects that there is something deeper and more sinister at work than simply a serial killer, so he enlists the help of Dr. Turner. Together they travel through time and develop a close relationship trying to stop five evil Druids who are trying to perfect a failed ritual performed 1,000 years ago.<br />The good:<br />+ Graphics: Beautifully rendered backgrounds rival those of ""The Longest Journey"" for detail and inventiveness<br />+ Music: instead of looping, music cycles much like in Myst 3. There was lovely accordion-themed music in France, and the rest of the music was pleasing without being Muzak-like or too repetitive<br />+ Storyline was very original, with many unforeseen twists and turns to add suspense<br />+ Many fascinating characters from both the past and present: Maglor, Capitain deNeuve, Pierre, Brent, Melanie, Dr. Blake, Chris Hecker, Lord Sinclair<br />+ Variety of settings and famous places: Scotland Yard, Portsmouth, Epping Forest, Oxford Library and Museum, Carmors, France and Stonehenge.<br />+ Humour: A pizza bill for 270 pounds, Detective Halligan photocopying his face, Hecker's practical joke involving medical alcohol, Hecker comparing human remains to family picnics when he was a boy<br />+ Time travel: the game alternates between the present (disc one) and the past (disc two).<br />The Bad:<br />- 3D models appear dated and move unrealistically. Closeups in cutscenes are garish.<br />- Some puzzles obviously lack logic--i.e. robbing a homeless man for change since no one in the office will let you use their phone, a forensic pathologist giving a colleague a swig of medical alcohol, using a file folder to open a lock, why French towns have German names on the map<br />- Some of the voice acting was *terrible,* especially Dr. Blake. Detective Halligan and Melanie were serviceable if sometimes uninspired. It still managed to steer clear of the infamous ""We're Scots, God help ye"" badness from Gabriel Knight III.<br />- The ending was lacking. After solving the final puzzle we only see around twenty seconds of follow up. Not enough for the hours of gameplay invested...where are Halligan and Turner headed with their careers and romantic relationship? Does Detective Halligan get fired or awarded? Perhaps it is a tie-in for a possible sequel.<br />- ""Mystery of the Druids"" deals with some extremely gruesome subject matter in graphic detail: humans being skinned alive, cannibalism (was that dinner scene *really* necessary? And Halligan, why were you so enthused after learning you were eating human flesh?), murders and suicides. This is NOT a game for children, the overly sensitive, or the squeamish (hence the M rating).<br />The curious:<br />+/- This game bears some resemblance to Gabriel Knight III: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned in that: you alternate between a detective and his sidekick, and in both games they are romantically involved with each other. Both games relied upon a religious/supernatural cult (Templars in GKIII, Druids in MoTD) using babies in their rituals. Both games have some truly bizarre cutscenes (GKIII wins hands down for reinventing the story of Jesus, paired with some scary hallucinogenic dream sequences).<br />Overall this is a solid little game with an interesting atmosphere that allows you to explore the past and present for clues in order to stop a Druid ritual that would spell disaster for mankind. Not the best game I've ever played, but certainly entertaining.",[],B00006488S,B00006488S,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1016922203000,14,False,"An entertaining, frequently macabre Druidic mystery After waiting for more than five months after its release in North America, I finally purchased ""Mystery of the Druids."" I had read a number of negative reviews involving gameplay, bugs, and frequent system glitches, all of which caused me to wait a while before rushing out to buy a copy. But I had no problems installing or running the game on my computer, and was generally impressed with this mystery/thriller from German publishers CDV and House of Tales.<br />This was a labour of love for a small handful of programmers, and as such is not a totally polished, flawless game, but it has its bright points along with its flaws.<br />You play the roles of Detective Brent Halligan of Scotland Yard and Melanie Turner, an anthropologist at the Oxford Museum of Anthropology. Together you explore a string of gruesome murders in London known as the Skeleton Murders, for that is all that is found of the victims. Halligan suspects that there is something deeper and more sinister at work than simply a serial killer, so he enlists the help of Dr. Turner. Together they travel through time and develop a close relationship trying to stop five evil Druids who are trying to perfect a failed ritual performed 1,000 years ago.<br />The good:<br />+ Graphics: Beautifully rendered backgrounds rival those of ""The Longest Journey"" for detail and inventiveness<br />+ Music: instead of looping, music cycles much like in Myst 3. There was lovely accordion-themed music in France, and the rest of the music was pleasing without being Muzak-like or too repetitive<br />+ Storyline was very original, with many unforeseen twists and turns to add suspense<br />+ Many fascinating characters from both the past and present: Maglor, Capitain deNeuve, Pierre, Brent, Melanie, Dr. Blake, Chris Hecker, Lord Sinclair<br />+ Variety of settings and famous places: Scotland Yard, Portsmouth, Epping Forest, Oxford Library and Museum, Carmors, France and Stonehenge.<br />+ Humour: A pizza bill for 270 pounds, Detective Halligan photocopying his face, Hecker's practical joke involving medical alcohol, Hecker comparing human remains to family picnics when he was a boy<br />+ Time travel: the game alternates between the present (disc one) and the past (disc two).<br />The Bad:<br />- 3D models appear dated and move unrealistically. Closeups in cutscenes are garish.<br />- Some puzzles obviously lack logic--i.e. robbing a homeless man for change since no one in the office will let you use their phone, a forensic pathologist giving a colleague a swig of medical alcohol, using a file folder to open a lock, why French towns have German names on the map<br />- Some of the voice acting was *terrible,* especially Dr. Blake. Detective Halligan and Melanie were serviceable if sometimes uninspired. It still managed to steer clear of the infamous ""We're Scots, God help ye"" badness from Gabriel Knight III.<br />- The ending was lacking. After solving the final puzzle we only see around twenty seconds of follow up. Not enough for the hours of gameplay invested...where are Halligan and Turner headed with their careers and romantic relationship? Does Detective Halligan get fired or awarded? Perhaps it is a tie-in for a possible sequel.<br />- ""Mystery of the Druids"" deals with some extremely gruesome subject matter in graphic detail: humans being skinned alive, cannibalism (was that dinner scene *really* necessary? And Halligan, why were you so enthused after learning you were eating human flesh?), murders and suicides. This is NOT a game for children, the overly sensitive, or the squeamish (hence the M rating).<br />The curious:<br />+/- This game bears some resemblance to Gabriel Knight III: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned in that: you alternate between a detective and his sidekick, and in both games they are romantically involved with each other. Both games relied upon a religious/supernatural cult (Templars in GKIII, Druids in MoTD) using babies in their rituals. Both games have some truly bizarre cutscenes (GKIII wins hands down for reinventing the story of Jesus, paired with some scary hallucinogenic dream sequences).<br />Overall this is a solid little game with an interesting atmosphere that allows you to explore the past and present for clues in order to stop a Druid ritual that would spell disaster for mankind.

5.0,"A hip, hilarious sendup of just about...everything.","""Grim Fandango"" is the coolest game *ever* even though it was released in 1998. It isn't your average game: from beginning to end you travel for four years through the Land of the Dead. You play as Manuel (Manny) Calavera, travel agent with the DOD (Department of Death) in a city named El Marrow that is an Art Deco, stylized Mexico City of sorts. Your job: to find the woman of your dreams that you accidentally sent packing. Oops. Along the way you have to avoid being sprouted, blown up, decapitated...not an average day's work, amigo.<br />The game incorporates various elements from Mexican/Aztec culture, especially the artwork adorning buildings (the DOD office, the S.S. Lamancha, the temple in Year Four). There are also spoofs in the game of film noir (Casablanca:Manny's casino), Las Vegas-style casinos and neon lights (El Marrow towards the end, Rubacava), hippies (the audience in the Blue Casket, open mic night and phrases like daddy-o, hepcat, and the man), and pretty much everything else thrown in (giant kitty litter boxes, claustrophobia, French waiters, hangovers, romantic tension, gunfights, fistfights, fast cars. Jokes are fast and furious and always hit the mark. ""Grim Fandango"" features the best writing I have ever seen in a game. This seems more like a Tim Burton meets Woody Allen project (think Nightmare Before Christmas): talking skeletons who smoke, drink, gamble and cheat on one another (some that are overly neurotic/paranoid (Chowchilla Charlie), swearing sailors (Toto, Naranja), morbid coroners, deranged florists, femme fatales (Meche, Olivia), perky coatgirls and plenty of baddies.<br />Even though the game is four years old, the 3D graphics still look wonderful, and the cutscenes flow smoothly. Load times were not terrible considering rendering requirements. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing (it can be purchased through LucasArts), covering Mexican mariachi, Andean panpipes, jazz and Spanish-influenced orchestral music.<br />Nothing objectionable violence wise, some mild swearing, a few risqu&eacute; jokes and a disclaimer saying that ""Grim Fandango"" glorifies smoking and alcohol use along with the following: the characters are already dead so it's ok.

5.0,Amerzone=amerzing!,"I have read several negative reviews of Amerzone, but after playing it several times these are my impressions.<br />When I first saw the cold grey windswept coast of Brittany I was amazed. I could hear the wind whipping against the rocks, and could almost feel the sea spray. The grey clouds were very low and threatening, and the crash of the waves could have easily been thunder.<br />The interface was very easy to learn. I had trouble seeing in darker areas inside the lighthouse even when my monitor was set to 100% brightness, but that was the only trouble spot.<br />I was glad to get on the way to Amerzone, finding the first level a tad colourless and boring. The puzzles were of medium difficulty, based more on surroundings than on some obscure facts or useless trivia à la Riven.<br />The game is simply chock full of detail, right down to props. My Casablanca-loving friend was thrilled to see that movie poster on the wall in the boat bar (did you catch it as well?). But my favourite part was the animals, plant life, and insects of Amerzone.<br />The journal was full of watercolour sketches of different birds, insects and animals that lived in the Amerzone jungle as well as sketches of the native tribe that lived there. I tried to find all of the species in the jungle, and was missing only one.<br />I only encountered one native woman in the Amerzone, along with a guard and a priest, but you can definitely feel the presence of many, many others. The Spanish village was a nice touch, as was the broadcast in Spanish by the Amerzone dictator. Everything felt totally authentic, and I wanted to book a flight down there for a week or two.<br />There is not much in the way of music, but sound effects are abundant and very well done. There are often several layers of sound for a single location, such as water lapping, trees creaking, insects buzzing, foreign birdcalls, and strange grunts and snorts from unknown animals.<br />The 360 degree panning was excellent and reminded me of &quot;Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time&quot; although in all honesty the graphics are sharper in Amerzone. The backgrounds are photorealistic watercolours for the most part, and the characters are more cartoonlike and stylized. The animation quality was top notch as well.<br />Unlike some, I do not dislike the ending. I thought it was more realistic, more true to the world of the Amerzone and the effects of Spanish colonization and an opressed people. It is not a fairy tale ending by any means but it does provide closure to your mission.<br />Amerzone was an experience from the beginning to the end. True, gameplay was short, but the beautiful locations and thoughtful, engaging storyline should make up for it.

4.0,Easy to Set Up,"I am not a fan of a lot of modern video games, especially first person ones. I'm in my early 50's and I like the old games that have simpler graphics. They don't cause motion sickness to me! My family, however, are all fans of video games. I did give this a try though. First, it was easy to download the game.  The design/appearance of the game is fairly stylized and cartoonish. They aren't trying to be realistic as far as the characters go. My husband was the first to play it. There isn't a lot of guidance, so he was just trying it on his own. The game works by using the included gun. He couldn't figure out how to pick up a found weapon. It was too new to find anything online, so he gave up. However, later our 21 year old son played it and he didn't have any problems getting the new weapon. Finally, I gave it a try. It didn't make me feel sick to play, even as I roamed around the ship. I found it was easy to point and shoot. In fact, I thought it was easier to use than the Nitendo Duck Hunt game of many years ago. The game itself is okay. You go around a cruise ship, shooting zombies. There is blood and gore, but since it's cartoonish, it's not too bad.  It did seem a bit repetitive in the short time we played. It seemed to start over at times. Of the three of us, we did enjoy the playtime, but none of us have gone back and played it again.

5.0,Very Responsive Key Board,"My husband is both a computer programmer and a gamer. He enjoys using gaming keyboards with his computer rather than traditional ones. This Logitech one is working quite well. He likes the click clack sound that gaming keyboards often make, but sometimes the sounds are over exaggerated. The sound on this one is a little quieter than his previous one, which he likes. He still gets the satisfaction of hearing his movements, but it's a bit more subtle. The back light feature is fun, but he doesn't always use it. He has been playing around with that feature and there are all kinds of different light patterns.

4.0,Works Well,"My husband and son both do a lot of gaming on their PCs. I first offered this gaming keyboard to my 18 year old son. He tried it for a couple of days and decided that it was too small for him, so my husband took it. He’s been using it as primary keyboard ever since. It is smaller in size compared to a lot of keyboards because it doesn’t have the number pad on it. The keys stand out more than a lot of contemporary keyboards, but my husband actually likes it. It has the “old days” feel to it, but with the anti-ghosting feature, it is definitely not an old keyboard. The keys make a clicking sound when pressed which is surprisingly satisfying. Once it’s plugged in, it’s ready to work. He’s using it with Windows 10 without any difficulties. My husband is a software developer and is using this keyboard on the days he’s programming from home, so a good, responsive keyboard is imperative.

5.0,A Hit with My 18 Year Old Son!,"My 18 year old son has replaced his regular mouse with this gaming mouse and he loves it!  First of all, it's really cool looking.

It fits in his hand well and is comfortable to use, even for long periods of time. It's smooth and not jerky. He's learning all of the different buttons and controls, but so far,  his favorite feature is the button that allows him to change the sensitivity of the mouse.

5.0,"Enormous Amount of Review Material, Many Practice Tests, Clearly Explained Answers","This BARRON’S AP ART HISTORY WITH ONLINE TESTS book holds an enormous amount of art history review material, many practice AP tests, and clear explanations of why the correct answers are correct.  The major drawback is that all of the illustrations of the art under discussion (paintings, architecture, sculpture, etc.) are printed in black and white.<br /><br />Actually, because the book’s paper is very cheap, the illustrations are gray and white, and are totally lacking in detail.

3.0,Extremely Comfortable Large Mouse With Chroma Colors,"At first, I thought I would really love this large RAZER MAMBA WIRELESS GAMING MOUSE (16,000 DPI Optical Sensor; Chroma RGB Lighting; 7 Programmable Buttons; Mechanical Switches; Up to 50 Hr Battery Life), because it felt so comfortable in my hand.  However, it isn’t so easy to use.<br /><br />Yes, the mouse DPI sensing can be increased so that the cursor really flies across the monitor display, but the mouse movement doesn’t feel effortless to me.  I have to focus to control the cursor and land on the exact spot I want.  In regular use (not gaming), I end up setting the Mouse to a speed below that of my old wired ASUS mouse, so I’m getting no real benefit from the variable DPI settings.<br /><br />Also, the scrolling wheel always feels loose.  For some reason, I don’t get steady or consistent scrolling from the wheel.  Maybe I just don’t know how to scroll like an expert.<br /><br />The mouse works beautifully as a wireless mouse.  It’s a bit clunky as a wired mouse, because the braided cord is thick and heavy.<br /><br />The Chroma capability is nice--you can set the lighted portions (the Razer symbol on the top and the scrolling wheel) to any color you want, or to set them to cycle through different colors.<br /><br />You need the free Razer Synapse software to set the Chroma colors, and also to program the buttons.

2.0,Doesn’t Work With Synapse 3.0 Programming Software; Has Problems With Synapse 2.0 Software,"First, this RAZER BLACK WIDOW ULTIMATE ESPORTS GAMING KEYBOARD (Green Mechanical Switches (Tactile and Clicky)) is NOT a “Chroma” keyboard that allows you to change the backlighting color with Razer Synapse software.  Instead the backlighting color is green only, and is subject to software adjustment in overall brightness and contrast only.<br /><br />Second, this keyboard does NOT work with Razer Synapse 3.0, the latest version.  If you already have that version on your Win10 PC, you will need to download Razer Synapse 2.0 (currently 2.21.21.1) to be able to make adjustments via software to the backlighting and the key assignments.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the 2.0 software can’t load the image of the keyboard when you go to the configurations, so it’s hard to program the keys with the software.  Also, having two versions of Razer Synapse on my PC played havoc with my Internet connection when I was connected to Razer Central--different browsers refused to connect to web sites (even Google) on the basis that my connection wasn’t secure, even though the connection had been secure by default.  It had somehow gotten changed so it was NOT secure.<br /><br />Fortunately, it is possible to dim the backlighting with the keyboard alone (FN + F11 or F12).  It is also possible to program some keys with the keyboard alone (see the poorly written quickstart manual packed in the box lid).<br /><br />Third, the backlighting is set to maximum brightness by default, and is annoyingly bright until you figure out how to adjust it.  Something that I did NOT like is that only the numbers and letters on the keys are backlit.  You have to peer at the keys to find the symbols, such as the @ symbol.<br /><br />Fourth and last, the mechanical keys have a nice feel, and make a soft popping sound as you type.

4.0,"Delivers Crystal Clear Sound, But Fits Too Snugly","This LUCIDSOUND LS30 WIRELESS UNIVERSAL GAMING HEADSET delivers crystal clear sound, but I found the headphones to be somewhat uncomfortable after an hour or so.  Perhaps that’s just me—I find most headphones that completely cover the ears to be uncomfortable after a fairly short time.<br /><br />Setting up the headset on my PS4 was something of a challenge.  The instructions are minimal, and it took me a while to figure out that the flat USB “base station” had to be connected via optical cable to the back of the PS4 console, and then plugged into one of the USB ports at the front.  Because there were instructions on how to put both the base station and the headset into pairing mode, I figured they needed to be paired, so I bumbled around until they found each other.  The light on the base station turned solid blue when they were paired.<br /><br />Then I did the really stupid, embarrassing thing:  I plugged the boom microphone into the mobile/Xbox input port, instead of into the oval microphone port.  This error turned the headset completely off, so that when I went into the PS4 settings for audio devices, the choice needed for the input and output device (“USB Headset (LucidSound LS30)”) was missing.  After I unplugged the boom microphone (which activates an internal microphone), the headset showed up in the audio device list, and I was able to complete the setup.  (The headset also shows up in the device list when the boom microphone is plugged into the correct microphone port.)<br /><br />Once the headset was set up, it performed beautifully.  I particularly like the chat volume control on the right earphone, which makes it simple to control the volume. There’s a nice option in the settings that lets you test the microphone volume by speaking into it.<br /><br />This headset also works as a standard headset when connected to a mobile device (using the included audio cable).  I plugged it into an iPad Air2, and the sound for music was pleasing.  It’s worth mentioning that none of the special gaming features work (e.g., the chat volume control I mentioned earlier) with mobile devices, as the headset is actually turned off.<br /><br />Because of the tight fit that makes the headset uncomfortable when I wear it for long stretches, I rate this headset at 4 stars (“I like it” on the official Amazon scale).",[],B01DUHQIL4,B01DUHQIL4,AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q,1469674211000,2,False,"Delivers Crystal Clear Sound, But Fits Too Snugly This LUCIDSOUND LS30 WIRELESS UNIVERSAL GAMING HEADSET delivers crystal clear sound, but I found the headphones to be somewhat uncomfortable after an hour or so.

5.0,This book is a master class on compassion.,"Wonder tells the story of Auggie Pullman, a 10 year old boy born with a multi-syllabic, nearly-impossible-to-pronounce facial deformity. Because of numerous surgical procedures and medical needs, as well as fear over being bullied or ostracized, his parents have kept him from attending public school. But at the beginning of 5th grade, they decide to enroll him at Beecher Prep, and now Auggie must overcome more staring, whispering, and ill-treatment than he's ever experienced, and maybe teach his peers a few things in return.<br /><br />I love Auggie's family in this book. Mom, Dad, and sister Via are not perfect, and Palacio's honest portrayal of a family that loves, argues, makes mistakes, and fights for each other is touching and relatable.<br /><br />I also love that the book is told from several different perspectives, some of them unexpected. It not only brought me closer to each character, but helped me see Auggie's situation - and how it affected those around him - in a much fuller landscape.<br /><br />There were times I was brought to tears by the simple tenderness of Palacio's writing, the gut-wrenching honesty and plainness of it. This is one time I was happy to have a print copy of the book (vs on my ereader), because it was easier for me to flip back through and re-read favorite passages, marking some as I went along.<br /><br />You get the sense in Wonder that each of the characters - good, bad, or seemingly indifferent - are just doing the best they can. I often wondered while reading how I would react to being the mother, sister, friend of someone with such a severe deformity, or how I would react if it were me instead. There is so much raw, honest, human emotion in this book, it's easy to put yourself in any of the character's shoes.<br /><br />With Wonder, R.J.

2.0,Meh at best,"[[VIDEOID:2ec704d684c477c4e2e7b52c3f394ed5]] There are not many full-sized mechanical keyboards, so I was really excited to try this one. Unfortunately, this fell short of expectations.<br /><br />From the outset, it has a lot going for it: linear switches, full-sized, dedicated media keys, etc. Unfortunately, that is where the good stops.<br /><br />First, the bad. Here are my major issues: First, the sound. When you are typing on this keyboard, it makes a very plasticky and hollow sound (see vid), which I wouldn't expect from a keyboard at this price point. Maybe for a very cheap keyboard, but not at $200+.<br /><br />Next, the software. If you don't use their software, the keyboard is constantly and annoyingly changing colors, which can be quite distracting. The software provides a lot of customizability, such as custom macros, colors/patterns, different profiles etc. Annoyingly, you have to have the software open in order for a given profile to take effect (e.g., after you restart your computer, the keyboard is going crazy with the lights until you reopen the software). Also, there is a 5-10 second lag after changing a setting in the software and it taking effect on the keyboard.<br /><br />The keycaps are glossy, so they show fingerprints, etc. Not my cup of tea, but some people prefer glossy keycaps.<br /><br />The stabilizers are okay (see video). There is a *tiny* bit of rattle on the space/backspace/shift keys, but the hollow/pingy sound may be due to the construction of the keyboard vs. the stabs<br /><br />Onto the good: the linear switches feel smooth. The media keys work well and are satisfying to press. I wish more keyboards had dedicated media keys.<br /><br />The cables are braided and high quality. I appreciate that they came with a Velcro tie to make them easy to wrap and travel.<br /><br />Overall, I would expect much more from a $200+ keyboard.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sHn2dnalL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sHn2dnalL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sHn2dnalL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81W2KJ6ac7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81W2KJ6ac7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81W2KJ6ac7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81dYhdpN1cL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81dYhdpN1cL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81dYhdpN1cL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BDB26VF3,B0BZW3Y5XX,AHUPTBY3F3UN2S5H7K5JLP6MAV5Q,1666565570028,0,False,"Meh at best [[VIDEOID:2ec704d684c477c4e2e7b52c3f394ed5]] There are not many full-sized mechanical keyboards, so I was really excited to try this one.

Also, there is a 5-10 second lag after changing a setting in the software and it taking effect on the keyboard.<br /><br />The keycaps are glossy, so they show fingerprints, etc. Not my cup of tea, but some people prefer glossy keycaps.<br /><br />The stabilizers are okay (see video). There is a *tiny* bit of rattle on the space/backspace/shift keys, but the hollow/pingy sound may be due to the construction of the keyboard vs. the stabs<br /><br />Onto the good: the linear switches feel smooth. The media keys work well and are satisfying to press. I wish more keyboards had dedicated media keys.<br /><br />The cables are braided and high quality. I appreciate that they came with a Velcro tie to make them easy to wrap and travel.<br /><br />Overall, I would expect much more from a $200+ keyboard.",meh best videoidecdcceebcfed many fullsized mechanical keyboard really excited try one unfortunately fell short expectationsbr br outset lot going linear switch fullsized dedicated medium key etc unfortunately good stopsbr br first bad major issue first sound typing keyboard make plasticky hollow sound see vid wouldnt expect keyboard price point maybe cheap keyboard br br next software dont use software keyboard constantly annoyingly changing color quite distracting software provides lot customizability custom macro colorspatterns different profile etc annoyingly software open order given profile take effect eg restart computer keyboard going crazy light reopen software also second lag changing setting software taking effect keyboardbr br keycaps glossy show fingerprint etc cup tea people prefer glossy keycapsbr br stabilizer okay see video tiny bit rattle spacebackspaceshift key hollowpingy sound may due construction keyboard v stabsbr br onto good linear switch feel smooth medium key work well satisfying press wish keyboard dedicated medium keysbr br cable braided high quality appreciate came velcro tie make easy wrap travelbr br overall would expect much keyboard

My son lmk.. after using his “broken/old” set for the past few months- this has let him hear sounds in e game.. he didn’t even know existed- it is endorsement x1000 for me!!<br /><br />•These headphones have a cord- why I Like: for any of us without tech. skills.. we don’t need to know how to connect a wireless version. These can truly be- unboxed, plugged in, and BoOm!! Ready to play.. it’s just that easy! I figure when ones gaming, you’re sitting positioned in front of the console anyway so, a cord is not a make or, break for me. When kids need help to set up system and I’m the only one to do it.. I MUST have easy. (If needing extra slack, you can move console closer to you and gain more slack.. so, for us- it works!)<br /><br />•Lastly, I love the mute option!! When mic. is flipped to an upright position, it puts everything on mute- letting you have a conversation with your player, w/o them shushing you.. this way the rest of gaming world doesn’t have to be privy to your chatter!! Apparently, telling your kiddo it’s “bedtime“ is the kiss of death in coolness factor! Flipping the mic. is awesome..<br /><br />•For a price point of $30- you get a quality good sounding headset that is respectable for any gamer..

5.0,"PS4 headset.. made by PS4 so, totally compatable!!!","This is a total find… I headset for the PS4, made by the manufacture of PS4 itself!! And- you get the brand name product for a great deal.. $29.95.<br /><br />The quality of this system is carried over into this accessory.. and I love the fact, this headset is designed to be compatible with the PS4 gaming system itself- how could it not, it’s made the the same people! Usually, as the parent who’s not sure.. I find myself searching various brands to be sure they’ll actually be compatible with the system- This eliminates that issue and gives the buyer some peace of mind.. it will work for the gaming system and work well!<br />I love the sizing and this has ample stretch to the headset!! My teenage son has a big “fat head!” Not to be mean or facetious but, he does have a larger noggin…So, I love this has the slide to become bigger or, smaller- creating a more comfortable and versatile fit for all. Too many times, my son feels the headset becomes too tight after wearing and it can even give him a tension headache. But, with the ease/convenience of some built-in stretch.. this can keep the head comfortable for a much longer period of time!! The material padding the ear is great- it’s not too thick and feels breathable-  this is quite nice so, we’re in for a longer time does not create a sweaty, prone to bacteria issue! The sound is up to par- made for the gaming system.. they have created a product to enhance their own games- Rainbow six siege sounds fantastic.. or, I’ve been told!! But, we have an “underwater exploration experience” adventure and interactive game- which takes you on varied levels of the ocean and as it does, the music changes to let you know where you’re at.. and just relax in the entire experience.. The headset allows you to hear everything with quality. Best of all- when listening with this headset… For the first time, we heard “underwater bubbles“ that have been there all along- they’ve just never been audible to us before!!<br />Big fat bonus: if, wanting to mute this headset? This is awesome- this has a feature to flip the mic. up into an upright position.. giving the ability to hear but, not be heard!!! Love this and the truth is-like it or not, we sometimes need to talk to our gamers while they’re playing.. instead of them saying something “embarrassing into the mic.,” my child always tried to communicate using hand signals- and he sucked at it!! Well, this makes hand signals... a thing of the past!!<br />So, If looking for a headset to be compatible with your PS4 system this is a great find!

He said it took him a bit to figure out- But, if the mic is placed in an upright position it becomes mute.. and added bonus once discovered! (I guess this is what instructions are for!)<br />Being he’s a full time student- he usually gets to game in little burst after school and/or, after dinner as his homework allows.. and trust me, he always finds the time to make this happen.. All week long he follows this playing pattern and had no complaints. But, on the weekend he gets a bit more time to play in blocks and these sessions can last longer then just his hour or so, like during the week.. I hate to admit it but, he can kick it on the wknds gaming with his friends or teammates for upwards of 2-3hrs. at a time.. And this was when he complained...

Im not sure if there will be any give to this as it wears in.. and if not, he’ll just have to use this when playing shorter game sessions-<br />As for the sound.. he’s not one that “knows” how incredibly well gaming systems can be heard in.. and I’d just assume keep it that way!!

Also brilliant is that the whole game runs kind of like a tutorial so you barely need to sit down and read an instruction manual (although we did and did need to reference back a little.)<br /><br />The pieces are cardboard but fantastic both in illustrative details and design.  There are wonderful little 3d elements that come up during the legends, again with amazing little details.  My oldest spent twenty minutes sorting all the pieces and showing me the details.

Lots of brilliant art and brilliant game design going on here.<br /><br />If there is anything bad I can say about this game, it is that halfway through the first legend in this box, the kids were begging to get the first two games in this series.

4.0,"Ah, the Geniuses of Marketing...","When I first saw this advertised at the Mall of America I was pretty dubious.  A video game that plugs directly into an entire line of collectible figurines...

5.0,Everything I hoped for and more.,"First I'll admit up front, I ordered this item for a seven and six year old which is under the age suggestion for the game.

It is a challenge for younger kids to grasp all the commands (the game comes with a 20+ page instruction book) but basic game play can be instantly grasped. And like many Wii games, it makes for great social play. That is if you don't mind the fantasy violence that comes in the game.  Also, in our case, where we have boys who have energy levels constantly at a 9 or 10, this game quickly pushed them to 11. It causes crazed game play at times, but they have not gotten out of control and they still talk after playing.

4.0,Good mouse but sensitive and not as advertised,"I bought this mouse to play SCP with my friend and it works just fine, but the sensitivity is pretty high.<br />The way the colors on it light up is pretty and it’s not a solid color when changing, but it’s not constantly rainbow.

5.0,Good for Giant Hands; Works Under Linux,"I am writing this review from the perspective not as a gamer but rather as a user who needs a comfortable pointing device. If you’re looking for reviews on what a wonderful gaming mouse this is, my review isn’t going to help you very much. If you instead want to know how it works for someone with big hands that does a lot of photo and drawing work, I have something to offer here.<br /><br />I have the hands of a gorilla (seriously, I can palm a basketball) and I have had a terrible time finding a mouse that actually fits my hand properly. Because of this I have spent a good deal of time researching other options for pointing devices that are comfortable, including writing/art tablets, track balls, pens and more. I was not thinking about this when I selected this mouse; instead, I was thinking of my son who is a gamer and is always looking for a better mouse. I’m keeping this one for myself.<br /><br />A lot of the reviews here mention that it is a claw-grip mouse, not a palm grip. I disagree, though I admit that I am not a typical user. It fits comfortably in my hand and I can rest the base of my palm on the desk and still reach the buttons comfortably without strain. This is good news for me, as most mice are small enough to require me to tuck in my thumb and contort my hand a little to get a good grip which just makes my hands cramp up.<br /><br />I used the USB dongle to connect to my systems, not Bluetooth, mainly because my Windows computer acts funny with other Bluetooth-based pointing devices. The system saw the dongle, loaded the drivers it needed and the mouse was dead as a doornail because it needed to be charged so it still did not work. I plugged it in, set the mouse to use the USB connection and it worked somewhat as a wired mouse while it charged (it was communicating via the dongle but getting power through the wire). Once charged I disconnected from the power source and it gave me no more issues.<br /><br />Operation is just as smooth and comfortable as I could hope. The buttons are firm but work well. I have tried all of the “standard” buttons and they work just fine – left-click, right-click, page forward, page backward and scroll. These are all I really need, though I like having the other buttons available should I need them later.<br /><br />The precision is good and it works well for pixel-peeping when working with digital images. That’s about as close to gaming as I will get with this mouse. I need precision, not speed.<br /><br />So, the main event for me: I plugged in the dongle in my Linux laptop and set the mouse to talk to it. I did not have access to all of the extra programmable buttons but the basic functions worked which is all I really need.<br /><br />I realize I am not the normal user for such a mouse as this, but in my case this mouse works well for me and I am very pleased.

5.0,Good for Gaming and for Pixel Work; Works Under Linux,"I have a son who is a gamer and I selected this mouse for him. The mouse he has been using for gaming has worked out well enough, though it is an inexpensive gaming mouse and it shows. I don’t care for the hand feel, either. I was unaware that Alienware gaming mice even existed but based on their laptops and tower systems I made the assumption that this would be a good one. I was right.<br /><br />First things first – I have large hands and most mice do not fit my hands too well. This one is slightly larger than the average and as such it does fit my hands a little better. For someone with really small hands this might not be the very best fit, but for the average person or someone with larger than average hands, this one is a comfortable fit.<br /><br />The mouse comes with two sets of replaceable side panels, which connect to the mouse body via magnets and provide different button layouts. Serious gamers will like the configurability and will appreciate having more buttons available. People with more business uses for this mouse may not care, though having the buttons available does allow for setting up speed buttons.<br /><br />This is a wired mouse (as most quality gaming mice are) and the cable is encased in braided nylon. This should last a good while and resist fatigue. In my experience, the cables often wear out before the mouse itself does.<br /><br />This mouse is a smooth operator. The buttons are solid and there does not seem to be any hitches in the moving parts. The thumb wheel works well and is smooth. The sensor is a red LED underneath and it works well enough on non-reflective surfaces (rare is the mouse that works on glass or a mirror).<br /><br />The precision can be set as high as 12,000 DPI and that is useful for when you’re doing serious pixel work in image processing. I can’t really comment on how it does for gaming, though for someone with a really steady hand and a good eye this pinpoint accuracy can be an edge in a tight game.<br /><br />And…it works under Linux! I plugged it into my Linux machine and it immediately started working. It required no drivers and it just worked. I did not try everything with it, but the main functions work flawlessly. No complaints.<br /><br />This is not an inexpensive mouse, but you get what you pay for with it.

4.0,Good Gaming Mouse; Not One-Size-Fits-All,"I have been looking for a good gaming mouse for my teenage son who is a bit fussy about the mouse he uses when gaming with friends. His requirements are simple but pointed – it needs to be fast, it needs to be comfortable in his hand, and it cannot hesitate or skip. For him, this mouse fits the bill nicely and it has worked out for him. For me, I have found that it is slightly awkward to use. To summarize in a single sentence, this is not a one-size-fits-all gaming mouse, though most serious gamers will appreciate it after getting used to it.<br /><br />My issue with it is not really the size. I like a larger mouse and this one is definitely large enough to fit my hand. However, the shape is a bit strange to me and it feels funny when I try to work with it. This is a personal preference but it is important enough to me to make mention of it. My son loves this mouse and says it is the best gaming mouse he has used so far, and since he is the primary user I can't complain – much.<br /><br />Other than the subtly odd shape, this is a nice mouse. It is very responsive and precise which is critical for gaming mice of any kind. It seems to be quite durable and well constructed too so it should be able to handle some serious abuse. Time will tell, of course.<br /><br />I am used to mice that have 3, 5 and occasionally 7 buttons. This one has 17! Using the included software, this is a highly programmable mouse and you can set the bank of 12 side buttons as you like, which is a great advantage when gaming to have complicated functions mapped to a single button. This  can also be a curse if you have so many things assigned that you lose track of what is mapped to each button.<br /><br />This really is a good gaming mouse that will serve well. It is well made and highly configurable. In my case I do not like the hand feel, but for my gamer son it has quickly become critical equipment.",[],B01MU3DZ2V,B01FSK99PS,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,1491297174000,0,False,"Good Gaming Mouse; Not One-Size-Fits-All I have been looking for a good gaming mouse for my teenage son who is a bit fussy about the mouse he uses when gaming with friends.

5.0,A Little Better than Solid Stainless Steel Cubes,"Whiskey stones are a creative way to chill a drink without diluting it with ice and without having to freeze the cup or glass beforehand. They are usually either stainless steel or soapstone stones and they get chilled in the freezer for a time before hitting the glass. They cool the surrounding liquid but they themselves do not melt so the drink is not diluted.<br /><br />I have worked with other sets of whiskey stones but these are different. In appearance they are stainless steel stones and there is no reason to believe that they are anything but solid steel cubes when you look at them. However, this is not the case. If you pick one up and shake it gently you can tell quickly that they are actually filled with some form of liquid. It is unclear from the description what this liquid is, but if I had to guess I would assume it is either the same stuff in a freezer pack or an alcohol based slurry. Regardless, these freeze well and are ready to go in 1-2 hours.<br /><br />Dropped in a glass of room-temperature liquid, these start to the chill the liquid almost immediately and they seem to be about as effective as regular ice cubes. The beverage cools fairly fast (though still more slowly than with ice cubes) and because they are sealed they do not dilute the drink at all.<br /><br />In the package is a small bag that allows for easy storage and transport without getting them oily or dirty. The bag is made of tight nylon and while is nothing fancy it is effective.<br /><br />If I could change one thing about this product it would be to add 2 to 4 more in the package. Four is certainly enough to cool a single beverage, but more allows for sharing with a friend. Adding more cubes is not a functional difference, but more of a social one.<br /><br />I like these cooling cubes. They work a little better than solid stainless steel cubes and they are ready to go in less time in the freezer than other cubes. This is a nice set and I have no issue with recommending it. Just keep in mind that there are only four in the set; if you want to have a drink with a friend you may need another set.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Excellent Midrange Gaming Headset,"I have numerous pairs of higher-end headphones but up to this point I have had no gaming headsets, so I was not entirely sure what to expect with the CM Storm Pulse-R headset. I have a teenage son who plays cooperative games on-line with a friend of his and so I let him use them for that purpose.

4.0,Good upgrade from previous versions,"Fritz is arguably the most commercially-successful and popular chess package available. I started using Fritz at version 6 and have purchased most of the upgrades, up to version 10. With each successive version the whole package has gotten better and better though some of the upgrades were more worthwhile than others (one reason I never purchased version 11). Version 12 is a quantum leap forward, though it is still not perfect.<br /><br />Installation from the DVD was painless and uneventful. However, there is one issue with the installation that bothered me - the installer never installed a desktop icon or a program group, so I needed to navigate to the installation directory, from which I made a shortcut to the application binary on the desktop. After this step, everything has worked smoothly and I can launch the application without issue.<br /><br />The interface has gotten a huge facelift - this is not a color scheme change or rearrangement of the menus and toolbars, but rather it is a complete overhaul with Windows ribbon controls serving up the components. Normally, I would be wary of such a large change to the overall interface, but ChessBase has done an excellent job of designing the interface and it is very well-organized. There is a learning curve, though, for people who have grown very accustomed to the older ChessBase interface, as some things are a little difficult to find unless you have familiarity... Given a couple of hours of exploration, the interface becomes second nature and finding things becomes easy again.<br /><br />The Fritz engine itself is a strong one, able to crush practically any human player (including seasoned grandmasters) with ease when used at full playing strength and it holds its own against other top-drawer engines. It is not the strongest engine available, but for the vast majority of players it doesn't need to be the strongest. When using an engine this strong, playing against it is not the most useful activity; where engines of this strength are most useful is in the analysis of games.<br /><br />Fritz includes several analysis modes, my favorite being full analysis for post-mortem scrutiny of games. The full analysis function works backward through a game and adds move suggestions as well as canned commentary as the selected chess engine evaluates each position. Though the English commentary is not always especially informative (for example, comments like ""This is a futile try to save the game"" are common), the comments do add a more ""personal"" touch to the analysis which would otherwise be simply a dump of suggested moves. When the engine finds an especially good move, the commentary is usually a little more helpful.<br /><br />I found an annoying glitch with the Full Analysis mode. After fully analyzing a game, the interface simply chopped the last quarter of the game from the report, even though I could still iterate through all of the moves. I never could get the rest of the analysis on the screen.<br /><br />Another very helpful analysis mode is ""Infinite Analysis"" which takes a single position and continuously analyzes it until the engine is interrupted or the position is changed. This is especially helpful for taking a deep look at a position and trying several what-if scenarios.<br /><br />Deep position analysis is another mode, as is Monte Carlo, though I have used these so little that I cannot really comment on them.<br /><br />The last analysis mode I will talk about is ""Engine Shootout"" which takes a position and feeds it to two or more engines for analysis. These engines evaluate the position and play through, with the intent of determining how the game would proceed and the outcome as a result. Though it's a feature I really don't need, it is something I use occasionally to look at games I have played when the game was unfinished but the outcome wasn't clear. Different engines arrive at different conclusions which makes this even more intriguing.<br /><br />The Fritz package includes a large database of games, which can be used to explore and analyze. Where I find this database to be most useful is in researching specific styles of play. For example, it is easy to track down all of Tal's games and follow his playing style with the database search functions.<br /><br />Also included on the DVD is a set of training videos. To be honest I have never found these to be especially helpful but others may very well benefit from them.<br /><br />The UCI interface continues to improve, so adding in UCI engines is easy and reliable. I have found several weaker engines against which I can play so I have them bound into the interface for playing. I use the Fritz 12 engine for analysis after the fact.<br /><br />Central to the Fritz interface is access to the ChessBase chess server. Through the interface, players can log into the server, play games, read chess-related news, watch seminars, and observe important matches with live coverage.<br /><br />There are a couple of different versions to this package. The version sold by ChessBase and its resellers sports a green box whereas the version sold through Viva Media comes in a black box. I noticed an appreciable price difference and I investigated that difference. The software appears to be the same; the real difference is in the access given to the chess server. The more expensive package offers a 1-year premium membership which gives access to all content on the server such as seminars, elite tournament coverage and other content. The less expensive package also offers a 1-year membership but the access is more limited and excludes much of the premium content. Both offer guest access which allows anyone to log in and play games without hindrance, but as a guest so there is no tracking of progress. Which kind of access you desire should be considered when choosing which package you need.<br /><br />Fritz 12 is a big step forward and is a worthwhile upgrade from previous versions.

5.0,Award-winning for a reason,"Galactic Civilizations II Ultimate Edition is the latest and best installment of the Galactic Civilizations series, packing in both currently-available expansion packs in addition to the base game. It is a turn-based strategy/conquest game, allowing play to stretch out over days or even weeks. There is a lot to this game, but once you get the hang of how to play this game it is very much worth the time and effort.<br /><br />To be very clear, this is a turn-based game, not a real-time strategy game or a first-person shooter. If turn-based games do not appeal to you, look elsewhere. If you have not played a turn-based game in the past, it is a different experience from most other games on the market in that the planning and strategizing require thinking in a different way, and this style of play is not something everyone enjoys.<br /><br />One of the very first things that a player will notice about this game is that the graphics are absolutely stunning. Stardock put an incredible amount of effort and care into the interface, from the menus to the cut scenes. Everything is smooth, seamless and, well, beautiful.<br /><br />Although the graphics are well-done, the interface is exceptionally complex and busy. The player manages almost every conceivable aspect of the game -  economy and tax rate, research direction and funding, relationships with other civilizations, planetary production, fleet composition, trade and more. It is very easy to get lost in the sheer volume of options available.<br /><br />Gameplay starts with several choices, most importantly race but certainly not the only option.

The player gets to pick hull type, armament, sensors and everything else a ship needs to be a successful contributor.

It is important to keep in mind that some designs may not work well through the entire game but that sometimes a design should be retired in favor of new, more advanced designs.<br /><br />Gameplay continues until victory conditions are met. There are several conditions that can be specified - military conquest, diplomatic victory (peace treaties with all other major civilizations), technological victory (done through research) or even a cultural invasion.<br /><br />Every choice a player makes affects something else within the game. For example, higher taxes can cause a planet to mutiny and join a different civilization. More important, though, is how choices affect relations with the other civilizations. Most civilizations pay attention to ethical alignment and military might, and depending on how strong or weak a player's civilization can even incite a war. Finding a good balance is the key, and finding that balance is inherently tough.<br /><br />As this version comes with both expansion packs, there are three campaigns that are available for play.

It is a turn-based strategy/conquest game, allowing play to stretch out over days or even weeks. There is a lot to this game, but once you get the hang of how to play this game it is very much worth the time and effort.<br /><br />To be very clear, this is a turn-based game, not a real-time strategy game or a first-person shooter. If turn-based games do not appeal to you, look elsewhere.

Stardock put an incredible amount of effort and care into the interface, from the menus to the cut scenes.

4.0,Excellent sudoku game for most players,"Sudoku puzzles are a fun distraction and many, many people have jumped on the bandwagon.

Being unwilling to buy an endless supply of books, I picked up this Sudoku program, which came with a Kakuro program as a bonus.<br /><br />This Sudoku program is user friendly, pleasant on the eyes, and it does not annoy you with incessant chatter and distracting tunes.

You can get pencil hints, or you can check for errors. These hints come at a price, though - this particular Sudoku keeps score based on your solve time, and every request for hints reduces your score appreciably.<br /><br />There are three difficulty settings, from beginner to hard. The hard setting will challenge the average player but a strong player may find it to be insufficient in terms of difficulty. This is typical of most Sudoku programs though. There are definitely better programs out there if getting really hard puzzles is the goal. The beginner setting is very appropriate for anyone just getting started, though.<br /><br />I tried the included Kakuro and I did not care for it. The implementation was fine and it was similar in design to Sudoku, so the problem was not the application. The problem is that I do not like Kakuro as a game. I cannot blame the game manufacturer for that.<br /><br />If you want a good Sudoku program that has a pleasant interface and a good supply of puzzles, this is a good choice.

4.0,A good choice for new users,"Fritz 10 is the latest and greatest version of the German chess program put out by ChessBase, a specialist in chess database and playing software. It boasts a set of new features and improvements over its predecessor, and all indicators suggest that it delivers. That said, Fritz 10 may or may not be a wise purchase, depending on why you want it.<br /><br />I will start off by saying that if you are interested in this package as a playing partner and you already have a very strong chess engine to spar with, Fritz 10 is likely a waste of money for you. As another reviewer stated, the engine is so strong that it will crush all but the top grandmasters in the world, so casual play will be frustrating for hobbyists. However, if you want it because you plan to do some serious analysis work and you want the latest engine, it is worth more consideration, though there are stronger engines such as Shredder and Hiarcs. Fritz 10 does a nice job of automatically analyzing games, adding some natural language notations with the move notations, although it is debatable whether or not these notations are very useful.<br /><br />The improvements over its predecessor are mainly in the GUI, not the engine (although the engine shows some promising improvements as well but does not drastically demonstrate strength over its predecessor, Fritz 9). There are some new training features such as showing the engine's plans, which is a solid tool in the toolbox when trying to improve. The sparring and friend modes are also very helpful, though I must concur with the previous reviewer in that the engine makes some silly moves when you ""dumb it down"" to meet the player's skill level.<br /><br />The graphics ability of this package are much improved, offering better piece rendering and display. This is not necessarily a very important feature unless you like your eye candy.<br /><br />As a UCI client, ChessBase seems to have ironed out the problems of the past. The GUI even seems to have a fairly good idea of how strong imported engines are, which is made clear when playing rated games. In testing a few imported engines, Fritz 10 did well in managing these engines and everything was stable.<br /><br />Updates to the PlayChess interface include weather reporting. I have to ask: How useful is this in a chess program?<br /><br />Overall, Fritz 10 is a very nice package and is worth the money if you want a strong program that can analyze games and can connect you to other players on the net. There are stronger engines out there (and some of them are free downloads) so if you are looking for the very best engine on the market, this isn't it. Also, if you have an earlier version and you want it because it's ""the latest and greatest"" in the hopes of getting a hugely improved playing engine, you'll probably be disappointed.

3.0,"Good concept, but implementation falls flat","I bought this game based solely on the description on the box. I expected a game that had a trailing camera with good graphics, interesting combat, and an engaging storyline. I came away disappointed.<br /><br />The most disappointing aspect of the game is the combat engine. Instead of a realtime hand-to-hand combat system, combat is turn-based. This in itself is not a problem. However, when engaged in combat, the participants run forward, take a swing, and run back. They take turns doing this until someone drops. The whole scenario comes across almost like a game of turn-based bumper cars.<br /><br />Another issue with combat is the unexpected encounters that occur. In the opening stages of the game, the character must wander about in the woods, and very frequently the travel is interrupted by a message to prepare for combat. Often, that there are enemies nearby is a surprise as they do not show until the battle is joined. This kind of encounter occurs throughout the game.<br /><br />Combat is often imbalanced as well. It is too easy to die.<br /><br />The dialog options are somewhat uninspired as well, and the main character frequently talks to herself when trying to interact with inanimate objects. This is disconcerting, if nothing else.<br /><br />There are good and bad aspects to the graphics. The graphics engine itself is good, and the rendered graphical images are very pretty and inspiring. There is plenty of eye candy in this game for those that like pretty graphics and lots of detail. However, one aspect of the graphics that is frustrating is the changing camera perspective. It switches automatically from a side view to a top-down view depending on area transitions, and in the top-down view it is difficult to tell where the player is going and what is in the surrounding area.<br /><br />The storyline itself is engaging, and the developer did a nice job with it. Some of the side quests leave much to be desired, though, so it is a mixed bag in terms of gameplay.<br /><br />If I had to compare it to other games in the same general genre, I would describe it as a hybrid mix between Dungeon Siege and Arcanum. Unfortunately it borrows a little too heavily from Arcanum's pitfalls.<br /><br />I came away disappointed with this title. It has some good ideas and concepts that have been incorporated into it, but the implementation of those ideas make it less than ideal. Some players may find this game to be a refreshing change from 1st-person style gaming, but I found it to be clunky and awkward.

2.0,Disappointing implementation,"I bought this game after looking at several choices on store shelves, and deciding this was the best choice I bought it. I immediately discovered that my choice was a poor one.<br /><br />On the surface, this looks like a very capable version of computerized Sudoku, which is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted something with LOTS of puzzles, some variety in difficulty levels, the ability to print, and an intuitive GUI for playing. This version does all four of these. For that, it is to be commended - it has the features most serious players will desire.<br /><br />That said, the implementation and additional features make this game a less than ideal choice.<br /><br />One of the most annoying features is that it requires the CD to be in the drive when playing, and for some that is inconvenient.<br /><br />More of an aggravation, though, are the sounds for the game. There is background music that serves only to be distracting. There also happens to be a voice element to announce the numbers as they are placed - the voice sounds very much like you would imagine for an anime schoolgirl that's entirely too happy for her own good. I cut the speakers for that one. With no sound, gameplay is a lot more pleasant and is acceptable.<br /><br />The game allows the player to show mistakes during play. HOWEVER, once that setting is turned on, it is not possible to turn it off except when there is no game being played. For players that are learning to play, this is fine, but once a player knows the lay of the land, either the current game needs to be quit in order to toggle this setting, or it needs to be turned off at initial launch.<br /><br />In the box with the CD was a bright orange card that stated that there was an update to the game available to patch a problem with printing. While I realize that this likely went in the box after the golden image was sent to the duplicator, it still is annoying to find that your brand new game is already outdated.<br /><br />I looked for another Sudoku game the very next day and found a better one with more features, a better interface, and a smaller price tag.

5.0,This was better than the original campaign,"After completing the official campaign from NWN (hereafter, OC), I was left wanting something more. I was disappointed with the OC in that it was a little too easy -- there were too many opportunities to run back to the temple and stock up, even in the middle of combat situation. As a result, the OC was very unbalanced, although the storyline was good.<br />Shadows of Undrentide (SoU) is *not* a continuation to the OC, but rather is a parallel storyline, taking place at roughly the same time. Completely new characters, completely new setting, completely different storyline (although, roughly the same premise).<br />This expansion pack does not have some of the same flaws as the OC. The game is more balanced, with no teleports in combat situations and limited teleports overall. The puzzles are harder, and the rewards for completing quests are not unbalancing either. Further, SoU adds a few new abilities and character classes, as well as new creatures, that would have been welcome in the OC. This is more along the lines of what the OC *should* have been.<br />SoU is shorter than the OC, and for some that's disappointing. It's also a lot harder and takes more time to wade through, which makes it equal out to about the same amount of investment in time. It takes a good little while to work through the puzzles and side quests, which add positively to the game.<br />One negative -- the game's ending is very anticlimatic. Once you finish the final battle, you are led to a cut scene with a vague ending that is resonant of the &quot;...to be continued...&quot; cliche at the end of a bad movie.

I was disappointed with the OC in that it was a little too easy -- there were too many opportunities to run back to the temple and stock up, even in the middle of combat situation. As a result, the OC was very unbalanced, although the storyline was good.<br />Shadows of Undrentide (SoU) is *not* a continuation to the OC, but rather is a parallel storyline, taking place at roughly the same time. Completely new characters, completely new setting, completely different storyline (although, roughly the same premise).<br />This expansion pack does not have some of the same flaws as the OC. The game is more balanced, with no teleports in combat situations and limited teleports overall. The puzzles are harder, and the rewards for completing quests are not unbalancing either. Further, SoU adds a few new abilities and character classes, as well as new creatures, that would have been welcome in the OC. This is more along the lines of what the OC *should* have been.<br />SoU is shorter than the OC, and for some that's disappointing. It's also a lot harder and takes more time to wade through, which makes it equal out to about the same amount of investment in time. It takes a good little while to work through the puzzles and side quests, which add positively to the game.<br />One negative -- the game's ending is very anticlimatic. Once you finish the final battle, you are led to a cut scene with a vague ending that is resonant of the &quot;...to be continued...&quot; cliche at the end of a bad movie.

3.0,Somewhat of a disappointment after the original,"I bought this title (hereafter UT2003) the week it was released, with great excitement. I loved the original Unreal Tournament (hereafter UT), and I eagerly looked forward to the new release, as surely it would be even better, right? Perhaps not, after all...<br />Many will love this game, others will be disappointed. Unfortunately, I fall into the latter group. It's a good game, that much is undeniable, but I feel it's not up to the standard set by the original.<br />UT2003 is very demanding on the hardware, expecting a 733+MHz CPU, lots of memory, lots of disk space, and a decent video card. Granted, most of us have it, so the majority of players will not have an issue with it. For those still running a 450MHz PC, time to upgrade if you want to run this one.<br />The basic idea behind UT2003 is just like the original UT -- kill everything that moves and enjoy the splatter of blood and guts. The effects in this game are creative, well thought out, and well implemented. On a 1.8GHz PC, it's fairly smooth.<br />That all said, the graphics are not quite as nice as that from the original UT -- and UT was less demanding on the hardware. The images and clarity of such were better in the old game than the new, and there was much less slowdown when the graphics and action got busy. As an experiment, I loaded 16 players in a single player UT game and 3 in the single player UT2003 game. Hardware was 1.8G CPU, 512 Meg RAM, and 32M video. The UT, with 16, ran noticeably smoother and the graphics were better.<br />Another issue I encountered was in loading a profile. I made a mistake and tried to load a profile twice. UT2003 went into a loop that would not let me get to the task switcher or do anything that would allow me to break the loop. As a result, I had to hit the reset switch. *sigh*<br />Sound, specifically voices, are noticeably worse in UT2003. The voices are a little muffled and hard to understand (they are supposed to sound like intercom transmissions, but even so they are poor). The effects of explosions and gunfire are all right, but still not up to the original standard.<br />Yes, I prefer UT over UT2003, and I will probably just continue to play it instead. In my opinion, it is a better game when it comes to graphics and game speed. The creators of UT2003 made a nice game -- it is unfortunate that it could have been MUCH better.",[],B000065SQJ,B000065SQJ,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,1033656112000,21,False,"Somewhat of a disappointment after the original I bought this title (hereafter UT2003) the week it was released, with great excitement.

3.0,Cool ideas meet mediocre implementation,"There have been a lot of reviews posted for this game already, and they all seem to share the same basic sentiments: so close, and yet so far... Some are very original, some are just dry repeats of what's already been said. I will try to write this review in such a manner that it adds to the comments made, instead of restating them.<br />I bought this game after checking out the box on the store shelf. That was the only exposure to it that I had at the time. I finished it. Now I'm writing a review...<br />Many of the ideas packed into this game are original and creative, giving a whole new dimension to the gaming experience. The non-linear storyline is especially nice, as it allows you to follow your mood instead of trudging down a straight path with no deviations. This does have some issues, though, due to the implementation. Because you can take any path you choose to get where you need to go, it is very easy to circumvent points in the storyline by stumbling into areas of the map (via random exploring) that you otherwise would not find until much later in the game. This can create some real confusion when you get a quest in your journal, then talk to an/the NPC and IMMEDIATELY the quest is solved. This is a little sloppy -- it would have been better to either kill the quest, or just solve it the moment it is assigned, instead of making you go talk to another NPC.<br />By wandering the map aimlessly, I found places that were never mentioned otherwise but obviously had some significance based on what I found there. I have no idea what I missed or where.<br />The graphics are mediocre. Worse, though, is the very awkward interface. The repetetive actions are a tedium that most players will want to avoid, but alas it is unavoidable in many cases. Even allowing some kind of visual macro facility would have been helpful...<br />Another neat innovation is the intermingling of magic and technology. At one point my character attained some level of mastery in a magic discipline, after which I was repeatedly kicked out of blacksmith shops. Nice touch. There seems to be a little bit of an imbalance in favor of magic, but using technology is still fun and allows the player to try something really interesting in an RPG.<br />Some players are upset about the level-50 cap. Don't be upset about it, level 50 is high enough to finish the game quite easily. If you want to really go beyond that, there's a patch out there that lets you reach level 128, and at that point you're simply wasting your time because you're too powerful.<br />The distribution of new experience points for the player to allocate is one way in which a player can directly manipulate the character. The system seems a bit strange and awkward, giving one point at a time to allocate to one of dozens of options. You need to carefully consider how you allocate your points.<br />I must concur with one of the reviews I read -- this game caters to the male chauvanist pig, to the point of being a little offensive in a couple of areas.<br />Interaction with NPCs usually involves selection of canned statements. These can directly impact the game. This is a good thing. These same statements can be issued over and over and over and over, with no progress. This is a bad thing.<br />One interesting point is that the NPCs can get mad at you, and even leave your party, when you tangle with a game character that the NPCs seem to think is a ""good person"" -- even when said ""good person"" attacks you first. Not good. If you are the instigator, that's one thing. But when you're the victim, having your NPCs go turncoat is unacceptable.<br />So why should you buy this game? Well, you should buy it if you are extremely patient with software that sports poor interfaces, or if you have a lot of free time on your hands and the money's burning a hole in your pocket, or if you just want to try something very different in the RPG genre of games.<br />I give this game 3 stars for its innovations.

4.0,"Good game, but not stellar","I bought this game on the day it was released, with very high expectations.<br />I have found that this game is like a blend of two other games -- Dungeon Siege and Arcanum. It has the 3D perspective of DS, with the non-linear storyline and NPC interaction variety of Arcanum. This is an excellent combination for a game as it gives both sides of the house, thinking adventurers and mindless hack'n slashers, something to enjoy.<br />The tutorial at the beginning of the game is useful for learning to navigate and interact with the game and shows the basics of combat, item usage, and leveling up. It does not show everything, which is nice because it leaves the player in a position to learn some things on his/her own.<br />Where I feel NWN falls short is in the quality of the graphics. I was very surprised when I started up the game and the graphics were not up to standard with today's 3D games. More effort went into the actual gameplay, and that's where it should be, but the graphics lack in detail and richness in some places. This becomes especially apparent when interacting with NPCs -- they have no discernable faces!<br />This game requires much of your graphics card, wanting 32-bit color settings (NOTE: the game says it requires 32-bit color, but it runs fine on my system at lower settings). The higher the color depth, the better the game looks (to a point). I ran into an issue with the color depth and NWN wanting to crash -- new video drivers fixed the issue completely.<br />I tried the Aurora Toolkit and was rewarded with a null pointer access and an application crash. I had to use the task manager to rid myself of the application, and have not tried it since. I suspect that the new video drivers fixed this as well...<br />I have not tried the multiplayer capabilities, and therefore cannot comment on it with any degree of fairness. My suspicions, though, suggest that multiplayer is the way to go with this game.<br />This is a fun game that is guaranteed to eat up hours and hours of your precious free time.

5.0,Fantastic Earbuds,"My husband tends to blow through earbuds like crazy. He likes to wear his MP3 player while working out in the yard or BBQing.

4.0,"Cats, dogs, & horses, oh my!","For the longest time, I just couldn't get into Sims 3 more than an hour or so. I'm a diehard Sims 2 fan and in some ways, Sims 3 seemed to take a step backward in the style of gameplay I prefer. One of my biggest frustrations is how the game is designed to almost force you to play one family only, and although I like the open neighborhood, I liked the freedom in Sims 2 of being able to easily bounce around from one family to the next at my whim. Prior expansions would keep me interested in their new interactions for a short while, but then I'd get frustrated and go back to playing Sims 2. Generations bored me so much that I didn't even bother to buy Showtime & I decided there was no way I'd buy Pets unless there was a really good sale.<br /><br />That being said, the Sims 3 Pets expansion has gone along way to make my annoyances at the new gameplay style worth it to be able to play the game. The pets are amazing, especially the horses. The horses are incredible with everything that you can do, caring for them & training. The cats & dogs are adorable and I love how the cats will sit on my sim's lap. Like with many other Sims fans, I didn't really enjoy the Sims 2 version of Pets. The strays drove me up a wall, my only recourse was to get a mod to keep them under control so that they didn't tear up community lots. The strays in Sims 3 Pets aren't bad at all.<br /><br />The additional objects are nice, and the town Appaloosa Plains is pretty. I don't like multiple-function rabbit holes though, because I'm still having issues fulfilling missions. EA doesn't seem to be too good at fixing issues before they add more. However, I think Pets is a must have for the Sims fan. I do recommend buying it on sale because I think they're grossly overpriced. Definitely buy the physical disk too. Until there's some good policy changes I think having a physical disk is the better route in case of issues and needing a return/replacement.",[],B0054IV0A2,B0055VHUAM,AECGR42H24LUU7DA7HEUMCRLTX7Q,1351110452000,2,False,"Cats, dogs, & horses, oh my!

4.0,The best of the Sims 2 stuff packs,"I still believe the stuff packs are overpriced for the amount of stuff they offer. $12-15 would probably be a fairer price. So if you happen to find a sale, definitely go for it.<br /><br />Mansion & Gardens Stuff is by far the best stuff pack EA has offered. The three decorating styles; Second Empire, Moroccan, & Art Deco, are lovely. The flowers are shrubs are beautiful, a welcome addition to landscaping. I like how the windmill & solar panels will lower the sim's bills. The ceiling fans are a decorative object, but they do actually move so it's a nice realistic touch. I haven't noticed that they affect the temperature of the sims so they are probably merely decorative.<br /><br />I love the Mansard roof pieces. It makes it so much easier to have attic space that my sims can live in without being affected by the weather. I've had issues in the past of them freezing or getting heat stroke if I had bedrooms in the attic with certain types of roofs.<br /><br />Knock on wood, I haven't noticed any major glitches with Mansions & Gardens. What a relief. The grand staircases are very nice, but they sure do take up a lot of space. Your sims will autonomously slide down the banister. Usually we do not get any new interactions with stuff packs, so this was a nice surprise. Our sims can smell the flowers too.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't care for is that some of the new siding is too dark and there's only a few selections. I'm not really fond of the screaming bright yellow. I wish they would have added some of the previous siding colors we've had with the new corner trim.

4.0,Sims2 fun for a laptop,"This was my birthday treat for myself and it's turned out to be more fun than I expected. I've been playing Sims games since Sims 1 back in 2000, I'd say I'm definitely a hardcore Sims 2 player. At first I didn't think the Life Stories would be all that interesting to me, because I already have the Sims 2 base game and all expansions & stuff packs on my desktop. So I passed up the first Life Stories and Pet Stories.<br /><br />But then Castaway Stories came out, and it had new and different concepts from the prior Sims games. I've been trying to motivate myself to get on my exercise bike more so I thought perhaps it would help if I had something like Castaway Stories to play on the laptop while I exercise. As it turns out, it has been fun. The regular Sims 2 game will always be my first in favorites, but I sure have enjoyed Castaway Stories.<br /><br />There are some limits. I wish that we could add more lots, there's a way to do it with a 3rd party utility called SimPE but it's a rather intricate process. Plus, there are some troublesome bugs. My kids have been playing it lately on the laptop and have had trouble with characters disappearing from the family. Unfortunately there's little that can be done other than to start over. It's a known issue. EA has not provided any patches for the Life Stories series like they have for Sims 2.<br /><br />But overall it's a fun way for me to get my Sims fix in when I'm away from the desktop computer. The kids enjoyed it so much I am planning to buy Life Stories and Pet Stories afterall for them to play on the laptop as a holiday present.<br /><br />One thing I really wish is that EA would have incorporated some of Castaway Stories gameplay into Sims 2 Bon Voyage.

5.0,Far superior to SimCity Societies,"I wish EA had not decided to ""remake the wheel"" and take the SimCity franchise into a different direction with SimCity Societies. It was fun for a bit, but the long-time SimCity fan will get bored quickly. It was only a few days before I went straight back to SimCity 4, and I've rarely played Societies since. Societies is cute, but the gameplay only lasts for a few days before you've done pretty much everything it offers. SimCity 4 offers so much more. It's a shame that EA won't be offering a SimCity 5. They pretty much shot themselves in the foot with the limiting direction they went with Societies.<br /><br />SimCity 3000 is actually my favorite of the SimCity series but there are many aspects I enjoy with SimCity 4. My favorite is how the cities interact with each other, and how I can play the connecting cities. I've never been much of an arcade type player so the U-drive it missions tended to frustrate me. But if you like those type of games you'll like the U-drive it missions. SimCity 4 would be my favorite but I still have trouble staying profitable. But that's probably due more to planning mistakes on my part rather than the game.<br /><br />Another of my favorite aspects is a little side-benefit of the game. You can use SimCity 4 to make neighborhood templates for Sims 2, which happens to be my all time favorite of all the games I have.<br /><br />There is a lot of gameplay value to SimCity 4, much more than SimCity Societies.

3.0,It's O.K.,"There is a reason why I rated this game just a medium score. Maybe its just me but everytime I get ot my house it freezes up every couple of seconds. I have noticed some glitches in there as well but they don't bother me. Such as if you click your house the all of the chairs which were pulled out get closer to the table. Another thing that bothers me is that both of my sims if there is painting or a mirror they always go to that when they should be taking care of themselves but there not. I don't even know how to delete the items so I had to build a wall around the items which decreased my liking for the house.<br />  I also don't like if your traveling to a building you have to watch you sim being driven in town which can be a problem if your destination is on the other side of town and then you have to go back home. I'm usally patient about these things of with The Sims 3 but my patience broke. There are rewards are also to high the lowset one is around 5000 points and the most my sim had was 2000.

5.0,It has its pros & cons..but more pros!,"I bought the Switch a few months ago and now that I’ve spent some time with it (more than I’d like to admit ^_^) I wanted to leave a review.<br /><br />The Switch has many pros over other consoles, it’s main pro being that it’s a portable console with games that previously are only found on PC or console. I am a PC gamer and my PC is an absolute beast with an 8700K & 2080 Ti BUT the reason I bought a Switch is because oftentimes I am out and about and can’t bring my big honkin’ PC with me. Obviously I prefer my PC but it’s nice to be able to play games like Witcher 3 and then  when I have to go somewhere in the car or something I can seamlessly “Switch” to the Switch and continue my game.<br /><br />There are some absolutely AMAZING games on the Switch: Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Witcher 3, Splatoon, Super Smash Ultimate, etc., which are worth buying the Switch. This is especially true for people with kids as most of Nintendo’s big hits are kid friendly. You may not want your very young children to play violent games like Call of Duty or Battlefield 5 but they can definitely play a similar kind of game with Splatoon 2 only instead of shooting bullets to kill people they’re splattering paint all over each other.<br /><br />However the Switch also has its cons. Let’s start with Nintendo’s “E-Shop”. The E-shop sells games that are WAY overpriced. They charge $59.99 USD for games that have been out for years. The fact is you can buy physical copies of these games for less on Amazon AND you have the benefit of being able to resell the game later if you want too. Not so with digital games.<br /><br />Then there is the price. Yes the Switch is $299 which is cheaper than Microsoft and Sony’s consoles but when you factor in the cost of necessities that are almost required for optimal play (Pro Controller, SD card, Screen Protector) the cost adds up quickly.<br /><br />All in all though I do recommend the Nintendo Switch. It’s a great console for anyone who just wants to have a good time and it’s especially great for families or people with young kids who want to play games with them without worrying about violence, drug use, sexual situations, etc., that are in a lot of other games.<br /><br />5/5 Stars",[],B07VJRZ62R,B07VJRZ62R,AEBORGHNCXOCGYEJ4WCULQCQWLAA,1584271054054,6,True,"It has its pros & cons..but more pros!

4.0,A lovely little piece of nostalgia!,"As a kid I remember playing Pokémon Red on my Game Boy and Pokemon Yellow on my Game Boy Color and have so many fond memories of it.<br /><br />Now, as a 31 year old man, I bought this game with my Switch to try to relive some of those moments and enjoy the nostalgia.<br /><br />I haven’t played any Pokémon games since Pokemon Yellow so playing this game was a real treat!<br /><br />This game was really fun! I don’t regret buying it. But having said that it does have some flaws. Firstly: This Pokémon game was ALOT easier than the older Red, Blue and Yellow ones.

4.0,"Nearly flawless, but flawless for RPGs.","The Hori Digital Controller for the GameCube is one of my “grail” controllers. For over a decade I've casually eyed this controller, seeing its price rise from high double digits to what it is now. Still, I don't think the price is that bad for such a unique controller. I love it when companies take their own, fresh perspective on standard controller layouts without making them unwieldy. Comfort is usually the driving force for change, as well as quality-of-life improvements. 8BitDo has been doing a fantastic job in this regard, and now Retro Fighters isn't far behind.<br /><br />Retro Fighters (“RF”) is doing wonderful things in the controller world. My first controller was the Brawler64 when it came out in different colors. (While I was aware of the Kickstarter, I avoided it out of personal reasons with Kickstarter itself.) It was love at first touch. It perfectly conformed to my hand and felt wonderful. The d-pad could use some refinement, but overall it's great. Fast-forwarding through a bunch of controllers, we arrive at the BladeGC. I knew I had to have it. Initially, I thought 8BitDo would release a controller like this, or at least some other company, so I was super excited when Retro Fighters announced it. Though I'd still like to get the Hori one some day, it's no longer a must; it's wired and doesn't have features for modern systems. Let's list the upgrades:<br />- grip<br />- analog sticks<br />- two more shoulder buttons<br />- vibration<br />- Switch/PC buttons<br />- wireless (and 2.4 GHz to boot!), with both a dongle for the GameCube and one for USB<br /><br />Already this is the perfect upgrade to the Hori Digital Controller. The little Z button is missing on the front, but of course it's not a requirement.<br /><br />I'll start with commenting on the d-pad. It's…phenomenal. I'm *very* picky about d-pads. Nintendo's of course are best, with Hori a close second. 8BitDo's may feel nice, but they have a habit of mis-presses. This can be remedied by opening the controller and applying binder reinforcement tabs; not ideal, but definitely alleviates the issue. But this d-pad? Damn… My thumb *skates* across it. When I first opened it, I was a bit disappointed with how it felt. It's low and has straight corners. But during play is when I noticed how marvelous it is. I tried Crash Team Racing, Stardew Valley, and Shredder's Revenge. Every input was precise and correct, and my thumb was able to just skate across it with speed and accuracy. Mein Gott.<br /><br />I haven't extensively used the analog sticks since I didn't get this controller for them, but I tested them with Smash. There's an octagonal gate for each stick, and each movement was comfortable and, for the time I spent using them, precise as well. They're smooth but don't let your thumbs slide off. The tops are flat, with the outer ring (textured for gripping pleasure) jutting up just enough to prevent thumbs from steering off. They don't have as wide an area to move as the GameCube controller, or maybe that's because they're not as tall, but they work well enough. Because of how wonderful this controller feels, I now plan to get the BattlerGC.<br /><br />The vibration is subtle. I'm unsure whether there's an option to change the strength, but the manual doesn't indicate that so I don't think so. It's not too low so as not to feel it; in fact, I think it's the perfect strength if you prefer a little feedback without it dominating the hands. I've had some third-party controllers that freakin' rattled the whole controller. Super uncomfortable. The BladeGC's gives you just a small jolt to remind you that you got hit, loser.<br /><br />And the wireless connectivity? A non-issue. Since this is not Bluetooth, it can't be used with the Switch when in handheld mode; instead, the USB dongle plugs directly to the dock. The Switch then reads it as a wired controller (which must be turned on in settings) and away you go. There is no discernible lag from what I noticed.<br /><br />Now on to the “bad.”<br /><br />Material. The controller is already light enough, but the quality of the plastic is very light and feels hollow. There is no grip texture. Rather, the whole thing is smooth and my hands can slide a bit easily. This is something I noticed with other RF controllers, so I know it isn't just this. Based on how it feels, it doesn't feel like a premium controller, though I certainly consider it one.<br /><br />Stick placement. There is little distance between the right stick and the B button. I have relatively small hands (5'8"", so whatever size hand that coordinates to) and haven't moved the stick accidentally, but I always feel it when pressing the B button. This made me wonder how people with bigger thumbs will experience the controller.<br /><br />But that's it. No more bad. Everything good. Oh, maybe the back shoulder buttons. I prefer ones that stop with a noticeable press, but these go just straight down like a lot of modern shoulder buttons. Gross. Maybe the sticks can be bigger too, but I'll wait until I try the BattlerGC to comment on that.<br /><br />This will be my main controller for RPGs, or any other game that utilizes the d-pad and A button a lot.<br /><br />B for materials and stick placement, A+ for everything else.",[],B0BSKB5J22,B0BSKM755C,AEUAL3EJKUSTNB4YY6STLYGTJALA,1675192785824,3,False,"Nearly flawless, but flawless for RPGs.

4.0,Meets the hype--almost.,"I'm a controller junkie. I have controllers from old systems that I've rigged to work on modern systems, and even controllers for systems I don't have. It's great how companies manufacture different ways of making the gaming experience enjoyable.<br /><br />So I'm always down to try a new controller. No controller is ever perfect; I might have a few go-tos for different genres, but having a favorite means I won't have a favorite later. I've read around about this GuliKit controller. The technology checks out: Hall-effect sticks, mechanical buttons, and metal parts? Count me in! It's also in the shape of the Xbox controller, which is super comfortable.<br /><br />In the hand, this controllers feels great. It's got a soft, matte-like texture. It's not rubbery to the touch, but more of a grainy plastic. The area around the sticks are metal, but I'm unsure of the triggers. They feel plastic without me removing them. The buttons feel awesome. They're my favorite next to Nintendo's ABXY buttons. Because the buttons use a mechanical switch, there will be less wear-and-tear in the long run. They can be switched around for an Xbox-style layout, but I'm leaving mine as they came.<br /><br />The sticks are nice and snappy. They always snap into the center and feel good to move. I know they use Hall-effect switches (which also were used in keyboards long ago), and I'm aware of the technology behind it; I have no doubt they will prove better in the long run too, but I'm also curious as to what issues may be presented that haven't yet.<br /><br />There are a couple issues I have with the controller that I'll mention now. One is the positioning of the OS buttons. There's start and minus akin to the Switch, as well as menu, screen-capture, and a controller-setting buttons. I wish the menu and screen-capture buttons were swapped with the start and select buttons. I found myself several times pressing menu or screen capture when I meant to press start and select. The former buttons are placed where start and select normally are (at least for me), so I've had lots of accidental presses. I hope there's an update in the future that lets me customize any button.<br /><br />Another issue is the triggers. The back triggers have too much real estate, leaving the front triggers uncomfortable to press. I know this is completely dependent on the user's hands, but my index fingers rest on the triggers and I have to twist my hand to press the front triggers. This is a problem in games like Metroid Dread, which make heavy use of the front triggers. I know the Switch can swap buttons, but it doesn't eliminate the discomfort.<br /><br />Those are my only issues. Overall, I love this controller. The controller settings are another feature I love. Using just the settings button and other button combos, I can change the vibration intensity (thank you!), the distance of the sticks, and the distance of the back triggers, which I believe are digital with some analog distance. Gyro settings can be adjusted too but I never use that.",[],B09MS2VFSB,B0B93KZ9P7,AEUAL3EJKUSTNB4YY6STLYGTJALA,1669756607767,0,False,"Meets the hype--almost. I'm a controller junkie.

However, I wish they would've instead made them extend back more.<br /><br />Hori has released all kinds of buttons and d-pads in the past. Before getting this, I thought the d-pad may have been similar to the soft, low-set d-pad they have on their PS4 Mini controller. So when I opened up the box the first thing I handled was the d-pad. At first, it seemed nice, comparable to other d-pads. It's stiffer than I expected, though I hope it'll get easier to press with time. However, after using it for a solid two weeks, I don't think it will be one of my favorite d-pads. I'll get to that more later.<br /><br />Comfort-wise, it's nice. It's not great, but it's nice. Coming from the Satisfye, I expected these not to be far from that comfort, but after a while I find the Satisfye grip to be more comfortable. I know Hori wanted to keep the grip handles short to accommodate the dock, but I wish they instead extended it out and back instead. I'm finding that an eggplant back is better for gripping.

They're pretty much on par with the Pro Controller, and I love using them.

5.0,Has Hori finally been dethroned?,"Well, maybe not yet.<br /><br />To me, Hori has been the king of third-party controllers. They have the advantage of time and presence. From all the way back to the SNES era, Hori has been making controllers for all (or at least nearly all) major systems. Their stuff may not always be home-runs (heck, some of their stuff don't even make it to first base), but their stuff is usually the next-best option after first-party controllers. Sometimes, they even make controllers better than the first-party option (I nod to you, Hori Pad Mini for the N64), and they've made the best third-party controller of all time (I'll get you soon, Digital Controller for the GameCube).<br />Lately, many third-party manufacturers have been narrowing the gap between Hori and the rest. We have PowerA to thank for their excellent GameCube-style Switch controllers, and Retro-bit has been stepping up their game lately with the phenomenal Sega and Hori Pad Mini controllers. And now we have strong newcomers like Retro Fighters and, of course, 8BitDo.<br /><br />I've mentioned in previous reviews that I've dismissed 8BitDo as yet another sub-par third-party manufacturer. It wasn't until my Analogue Nt mini arrived with one that I tried one and swallowed my words. As an owner now of eight different 8BitDo controllers, I can say I'm convinced, and I now dare say that this may be their best one yet; it's probably the strongest contender to the Pro Controller we have.<br /><br />I pre-ordered the G Edition the day it was possible, and it arrived last night. I've played a few games, mostly CTR:NF. Here are my initial impressions.<br /><br />Out of the box, I immediately felt this was the Switch's version of the DualShock 4. Of course, that's not to say this controller is just for the Switch, as it works with many other systems, but most people are probably getting it for the Switch--including yours truly. The main thing I wanted to know is how the d-pad work, especially on the G Edition as it mimics the d-pad found in the DMG with the little grips. This is by far the best d-pad 8BitDo has produced. The plastic is sturdy, but it's also the same softer material you'd find on Nintendo's first-party d-pads; it also has rounded-off corners so that they're not sharp. Many companies' cross-style d-pads seem to be made of a harder plastic or have too-sharp edges, which can make for a sore extended play session. This d-pad is easier on the thumb, and the little grips indeed have some grittier surface to them that makes it easier to keep the thumb on. There's still that odd, scratchy plastic sound that seems to be on all 8BitDo controllers when pressing the d-pad, though it doesn't affect feel or gameplay. Anyone who owns an 8BitDo controller will probably know what I'm talking about; when I press my d-pad down, I hear this unpleasant, harsh ""thock."" Otherwise, this is probably the best non-Nintendo d-pad we currently have for the Switch. In this area, 8BitDo has passed.<br /><br />My next favorite thing about the controller is the L/R and ABXY buttons. They have the same, soft tactile feedback as the L/R buttons on the Pro Controller. I love it. I prefer these ABXY buttons over the Pro Controller. My favorite ABXY buttons were probably those on the Wii Classic Controller/Pro, but now I think these may be my favorite. They have optimal travel distance (not too much, not too little), and provide the same, soft feel when pressed as the shoulder buttons. Divine.<br />However, I feel that the L2/R2 buttons have too much travel. You can use the separate Ultimate Software to customize the input register, but all it does it just stop the input beyond a certain point. I prefer the L2/R2 buttons on the Pro Controller and DualShock 4. There's too much travel here for my tastes.<br /><br />I haven't really fiddled with the sticks much, but they seem nearly identical to the ones on the DualShock 4, albeit slightly narrower in girth. The travel for the actual gates are fine, but the sticks are just a bit on the smaller side.<br /><br />The handles are great. I felt no discomfort while playing for two hours straight of CTR:NF. I do find the controller to be a bit wide for me, and the L/R buttons are a bit too forward and far from my index fingers than I'd like, but I realize I may have smaller hands than average. The entire housing of the controller is made from a nice, robust plastic that seems like it'll last for decades.<br /><br />I've read reviews prior to receiving mine mentioning the weak vibration, and I do have to agree. Even after adjusting the vibration with the Ultimate Software (which you have to download separately), it left much to be desired. There's no HD vibration, but even the standard vibration here is a bit on the weak side.<br /><br />As for lag, I detected none. I updated to the current firmware as of this writing (v3.01) and the input is snappy.

Well, maybe not yet.<br /><br />To me, Hori has been the king of third-party controllers. They have the advantage of time and presence. From all the way back to the SNES era, Hori has been making controllers for all (or at least nearly all) major systems. Their stuff may not always be home-runs (heck, some of their stuff don't even make it to first base), but their stuff is usually the next-best option after first-party controllers. Sometimes, they even make controllers better than the first-party option (I nod to you, Hori Pad Mini for the N64), and they've made the best third-party controller of all time (I'll get you soon, Digital Controller for the GameCube).<br />Lately, many third-party manufacturers have been narrowing the gap between Hori and the rest. We have PowerA to thank for their excellent GameCube-style Switch controllers, and Retro-bit has been stepping up their game lately with the phenomenal Sega and Hori Pad Mini controllers. And now we have strong newcomers like Retro Fighters and, of course, 8BitDo.<br /><br />I've mentioned in previous reviews that I've dismissed 8BitDo as yet another sub-par third-party manufacturer. It wasn't until my Analogue Nt mini arrived with one that I tried one and swallowed my words. As an owner now of eight different 8BitDo controllers, I can say I'm convinced, and I now dare say that this may be their best one yet; it's probably the strongest contender to the Pro Controller we have.<br /><br />I pre-ordered the G Edition the day it was possible, and it arrived last night. I've played a few games, mostly CTR:NF. Here are my initial impressions.<br /><br />Out of the box, I immediately felt this was the Switch's version of the DualShock 4. Of course, that's not to say this controller is just for the Switch, as it works with many other systems, but most people are probably getting it for the Switch--including yours truly. The main thing I wanted to know is how the d-pad work, especially on the G Edition as it mimics the d-pad found in the DMG with the little grips. This is by far the best d-pad 8BitDo has produced. The plastic is sturdy, but it's also the same softer material you'd find on Nintendo's first-party d-pads; it also has rounded-off corners so that they're not sharp. Many companies' cross-style d-pads seem to be made of a harder plastic or have too-sharp edges, which can make for a sore extended play session. This d-pad is easier on the thumb, and the little grips indeed have some grittier surface to them that makes it easier to keep the thumb on. There's still that odd, scratchy plastic sound that seems to be on all 8BitDo controllers when pressing the d-pad, though it doesn't affect feel or gameplay. Anyone who owns an 8BitDo controller will probably know what I'm talking about; when I press my d-pad down, I hear this unpleasant, harsh ""thock."" Otherwise, this is probably the best non-Nintendo d-pad we currently have for the Switch. In this area, 8BitDo has passed.<br /><br />My next favorite thing about the controller is the L/R and ABXY buttons. They have the same, soft tactile feedback as the L/R buttons on the Pro Controller. I love it. I prefer these ABXY buttons over the Pro Controller. My favorite ABXY buttons were probably those on the Wii Classic Controller/Pro, but now I think these may be my favorite. They have optimal travel distance (not too much, not too little), and provide the same, soft feel when pressed as the shoulder buttons. Divine.<br />However, I feel that the L2/R2 buttons have too much travel. You can use the separate Ultimate Software to customize the input register, but all it does it just stop the input beyond a certain point. I prefer the L2/R2 buttons on the Pro Controller and DualShock 4. There's too much travel here for my tastes.<br /><br />I haven't really fiddled with the sticks much, but they seem nearly identical to the ones on the DualShock 4, albeit slightly narrower in girth. The travel for the actual gates are fine, but the sticks are just a bit on the smaller side.<br /><br />The handles are great. I felt no discomfort while playing for two hours straight of CTR:NF. I do find the controller to be a bit wide for me, and the L/R buttons are a bit too forward and far from my index fingers than I'd like, but I realize I may have smaller hands than average. The entire housing of the controller is made from a nice, robust plastic that seems like it'll last for decades.<br /><br />I've read reviews prior to receiving mine mentioning the weak vibration, and I do have to agree. Even after adjusting the vibration with the Ultimate Software (which you have to download separately), it left much to be desired. There's no HD vibration, but even the standard vibration here is a bit on the weak side.<br /><br />As for lag, I detected none. I updated to the current firmware as of this writing (v3.01) and the input is snappy. When playing Golf Story, my presses would stop the swing meter precisely when I intended, and in CTR:NF my power slides were easier to control than with other controllers.<br /><br />Finally, to give the Ultimate Software its own paragraph, I fiddled with it a bit to see what it's like. As of this writing (Aug. 9, 2019), it's available only for Windows machines. I had to borrow a Windows machine momentarily.

3.0,&lt;Loading...> Initial &lt;Loading...> impressions. &lt;Loading...>,"(For some reason my review keeps reverting to the PS4 version, even though I delete and resubmit under the Switch version. This review is based on playing the version for the Switch.)<br /><br />CTR was the first game I ever 100%'d. Even for years after, I tried my darnedest to unlock Nitros Oxide, refusing to believe all the confirmations out there that he just wasn't unlockable. My sisters, dad, and cousins would play this game non-stop for months. I still have my original copy, and purchased it on PSN for my PS3 and PSP. This is the only game I have to get on all possible systems (besides Plants vs. Zombies). So I was pretty freakin' ecstatic when they announced a remake.<br /><br />First, the loading times. They are awful. I was talking to a co-worker about the game this morning and he said he was reading reviews that the game was great but that they mentioned the long loading times. I didn't believe it, but I was wrong. They occur when you load up races, and at the beginning of the story mode. They sort of kill the enthusiasm. I had heard that they're not that bad on other systems, but on the Switch it takes anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute before every track. Definitely needs to get fixed. I can see myself bringing this to friends' houses only for the loading to create a buzzkill.<br /><br />Once you get past them, though, you can actually play. And here's my other biggest problem: the hopping. I can't play CTR without the boosts. I've played MK8D and TSR and I'm always drifting and boosting, and it's all thanks to CTR when I played starting 20 years ago. I don't know what it is, but the jumping doesn't feel the same this time. Either the jumps are too high or they're too long, but they're definitely floaty. I'm actually able to change the direction mid-air, which I don't recall doing. I played the original to confirm, and the jumps definitely are slightly longer/higher here than in the original. In the original, the characters feel a wee bit heavier, which is far better for power sliding.<br />Subsequently, I'm not able to time and complete my boosts as I was before. I really hope I'm wrong and it's just me being a bit rusty, but if it's not the same then I'm going to have to change the way I play this game.<br /><br />Now, as for the positives, I love the extra content they added without really detracting from the overall experience. The visuals are beautiful, and they've added things here and there to the tracks without really changing them (e.g., Coco's track has a statue of Coco, Crash Cove has a sculpt of Crash, etc.). I played CNK back when it released, but don't really remember it. I really like that they added the CNK tracks and the other character; there were a couple of CNK tracks I remember but the characters I don't recall at all. Still, a nice touch.<br /><br />The customization really worried me when they announced it, as I had thought it would change the driving mechanics, but not so. In kart racers like MK, there are way too many customizations and I can never find one that feels right (and by right I mean one that drives like CTR). Here, the customizations are purely cosmetic, which I more than welcome. Each driver is the same from the previous iteration, and the little changes to the character and kart are just for show.<br />Thank goodness.<br /><br />Here's hoping Activision/Beenox updates the loading times for the Switch and, if necessary, the jumps.

4.0,Not bad!,"So I got this with the intent to play Super Mario Odyssey. I received this and the official Pro Controller around the same time and, while I much prefer playing with the Pro Controller because of many reasons, I still use this one for other games besides Odyssey.<br /><br />The feel of this one is a bit on the light side. It's hollow, though I suspect that's for any lack of vibration. The buttons are nice and clicky, more so than the ones on the Pro Controller, and I actually prefer the buttons on this one. However, because of the slightly wider (larger?) size, the shoulder buttons may be slightly more difficult to reach than the Pro Controller. The thumbsticks are longer, which I do not like for platformers and racing games. They may be good for FPS games, but I find there are far more genres of games on the Switch than FPS.<br /><br />The back buttons are a nice addition, though I hardly ever use them. I've programmed them to duplicate L and R and thought I'd use them more often, but I don't. They work well enough and are positioned so as not to be in the way of accidental presses, but are within reach if necessary.<br /><br />The texture is a nice matte feel, so no sweaty palms.<br /><br />Overall, a great controller if you're looking for one on the budget.",[],B07GTL8JPF,B07GTL8JPF,AEUAL3EJKUSTNB4YY6STLYGTJALA,1558643791569,0,False,"Not bad!

3.0,Somewhat Satisfyed,"After much research, I decided to opt for this grip for my Switch. I obtain grips for all my handhelds, and since I play a good deal amount of handheld mode for my Switch, I decided to get this one as well. I did a lot of research and whittled it down to four; in descending order, they are: Satisfye, Skull & Co, Cyber Gadget, and RDS GoPlay.<br />My main requirement was that the grip would come with in a dedicated case, which left me with these options. (Though I also considered the Cyber Gadget one as they haven't failed me in the past, but unfortunately it neither comes with a case nor is in stock online.)<br /><br />After much excitement and watching and reading reviews, I placed my order. Before getting the grip, I had very little trouble with holding the Switch in handheld mode; it's the first handheld that has never given me hand cramps; perhaps it's due to the wider form. Still, there are times when my thumbs have awkward reach for certain buttons.<br />After I placed my order, my order arrived within a week from China. Nice!<br /><br />Now, the angled grips seemed like an intuitive choise. It's the first handheld grip I've seen that has asymmetrical grips so that you can reach both thumbsticks without issue. I was curious to try it and see how it would improve my handheld experience. At the moment, my favorite grips are (in no particular order): Hori's Monster Hunting Gear for the new 3DS XL, a speaker/grip combo I imported from a European company called BiGBANG! for the DS Lite (though I think it might be a rebrand from an American version), and Joytech's rechargeable battery grip for the Game Boy Advance (original, not SP version). Those grips bring the handheld experience closest to holding controllers. I imagine it's also due to the smaller sizes of the handhelds.<br /><br />So when the package arrived the first thing I did was tear open the box and grab the handle. It felt fine on its own, so, after my Switch was done charging, I immediately placed it in the grip. And right then is when I had mixed feelings about it. I knew the angle would take some adjusting to, so I played for two solid hours the first night.<br /><br />Here's what I experienced, and still experience a month later:<br />I prefer the right side overall, but I would find a perfect grip if both sides had symmetrical grips that were ""fuller"" like the right but angled like the left. I modified my Switch with a d-pad on the left Joy-Con and find that the Satisfye grip makes accessing the d-pad somewhat uncomfortable.<br />Also, because the grip has a lopsided layout, my right arm wants to pull at it to make it even, which causes the screen to go crooked. I think if they made it so that the bar across the back of the Switch would be lopsided as well, the screen would be even.<br /><br />Additionally, I found that, to compensate for the odd angle, my right arm tends to protrude out awkwardly sometimes. If you take notice on some of Satisfye's own marketing photos, you'll see some of these people hold their right arm out awkardly, too.<br /><br />I've gotten accustomed to using it for about a month, but it's still awkward; my right hand now prefers of the right side, whereas the left handle is very lacking. It feels insubstantial compared to the substance the right side brings. I do like that the case can fit the grip, some games, and a few accessories, though. Be aware that the case indeed is massive. It is perfectly square so the width is very demanding, especially in backpacks. The thumb sticks are okay, but I prefer the Skull & Co. and Cyber Gadget ones.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent grip and I don't regret paying the money for it. It's very sturdy and feels like it will last decades without wearing down. Unfortunately, I'm a ""one and done"" kind of person, and I was hoping I would purchase this as my one and only Switch grip.

4.0,Fun novelty controller. Embrace the size.,"You really don't appreciate how large this thing is until you have it in your hands. I remember seeing a friend's Duke back when the Xbox was brand new, but never was startled at the size. These days the more comfortable controllers are larger, and that's reasonable because, as an adult, I can't do smaller controllers or handhelds without larger gripping surfaces.<br /><br />But man. This thing is massive.<br /><br />I got the transparent green color as I love transparent video game peripherals, and green screamed Xbox to me. I'm usually not a fan of green, but I figured it was appropriate for Xbox.<br />I don't own an Xbox One, but got this to use on my PC mostly for Steam games and some others. It works great for them. For some games you can map the buttons.<br />I don't get why they decided to opt for a screen display if all it does is just show the logo; it would be neat if some games could utilize it for other purposes. I expect that some modders will do so.<br /><br />Most of the gripping area is unnecessary; you wind up just using the upper half for the buttons. The analog triggers and the vibration feel a little cheap on mine. The triggers squeak and the rumble causes the entire shell to rattle. Otherwise, everything else feels great. The buttons have nice tactility to them, and the digital shoulders feel great. The sticks are great and feel like first-party construction.<br /><br />I'm not sure why the cable is detachable; you can't use this controller without it, and it probably would've been better for longevity's sake to make the cable attached with a reinforced port.<br /><br />It's a bit pricey for what it is; I assume most of the cost goes toward the limited screen. Still, it's a fun thing to have in the collection, especially if you're a controller junky like me.",[],B07GC2YSBG,B07GC2YSBG,AEUAL3EJKUSTNB4YY6STLYGTJALA,1548877993220,15,True,"Fun novelty controller.

4.0,Another homer by 8BitDo (after some fiddling).,"I don't have an NES Classic, but after seeing this style controller for the NES Classic I was hoping 8BitDo would make a Bluetooth version, and here we are!<br /><br />I was introduced to 8BitDo when I received my Analogue Nt mini. I heard of them before but saw them as just another third-party maker that wouldn't make it as well as Hori. Two years later and almost ten controllers later, 8BitDo is already in my top three third-party makers list.<br />I became accustomed to the diamond layout of their previous N30; sure, it wasn't traditional, but it's more modern and I adapted to it well enough. But for games that require more precision, I fell back to my original NES controllers. This new N30 v2 is a far better iteration than the v1.<br /><br />There were two issues I found with it, however. The first being the update process. Always, always, ALWAYS update your 8BitDo devices when you receive them. Even if they just came out, the controllers and adapters almost always have a firmware update that you'll need to clear out some issues. So that's what I did here, but for some reason the update tool was a bit wonky compared to my previous experiences. 8BitDo has a couple of applications for updating the firmware, and it's either hit or miss on which will work. The first time I tried updating this it seemed to fry my controller. It wouldn't update and the controller wouldn't turn on for about half an hour. No LED lights of any kind, no matter how many cables I plugged in or what button combos I used. After leaving the controller alone for about twenty minutes, I went back to it and it magically started working again, and the firmware tool updated it fine. For the record, the stock firmware was some beta version, whereas the latest firmware (as of this writing) was 6.10.<br /><br />The other issue I'll get into in just a sec.<br /><br />I first paired this with my Switch since it's touted as a Switch controller for the Nintendo Online games. I don't have Nintendo Online as of right now, but plan to in the near future. For Puyo Puyo Tetris, it worked well. I thought the top buttons would be mapped as X and Y, but not so; they truly are turbo buttons even when paired with modern Bluetooth devices. The Home button worked fine, but I sort of wished it was a Capture button instead since I use that more. I know this controller is a carbon copy of their NES Classic version, so they just reused the front faceplate, but still.<br /><br />After that, I tested it with my NES Retro Receiver and Nt mini, and have been using it with that ever since. It works beautifully. The Receiver (and the Switch) recognize the controller immediately, and I can say that I experienced very minimal lag, if at all. I put away my diamond-layout N30 v1--which was my go-to NES controller--and supplanted it with this, which now is my go-to wireless NES controller. For more precise games like Punch-Out!! I still prefer wired controllers just for placebo's sake, but honestly I can't tell that much difference in lag between these two.<br />My other issue is that I wish the action buttons were just a smidge higher. The top turbo buttons are closer to the center than the main A and B buttons, but it's nothing to make my muscle memory miss a button. For games where I do need turbo, it's more comfortable.<br /><br />The buttons are clickier than overused NES controllers, but I have an original NES controller that is in near-new condition, and the clickiness isn't that far from home. The d-pad is great; however, I noticed mine has a slight angle that it wants to stay in. It's not anything that causes missed directions, but I thought I should point that out anyway.<br /><br />I know some people in the past claim they have mispresses for the d-pad, but I've never had that issue, and I still don't. Nevertheless, I went back and put some of those circle reinforcement stickers on the contacts of the PCB, and I might do that here as well, if just for peace of mind.<br /><br />Now here's hoping they make an FC30 v2 in this button scheme!",[],B07L9Z33MH,B07L9Z33MH,AEUAL3EJKUSTNB4YY6STLYGTJALA,1548370556979,7,True,"Another homer by 8BitDo (after some fiddling).

5.0,Worth getting.,"Out of all the third-party controllers out there thus far, this one is my favorite, despite it not having vibration. I wound up getting both the gray and gold (GameStop exclusive) colors. I have this one, the PDP, and the official Nintendo one (I also plan on getting the Hori one), and I've been using this one the most. In many respects, this definitely is the WaveBird 2.0.<br /><br />The build is pretty good, though the shell is made of pretty thin plastic compared to an original GCN controller. The PDP controller feels a lot better than this one. Also, with the silver and gold variants, the color is actually painted on; when I removed the battery cover I could see the clear shell underneath the paint.<br /><br />The buttons all feel really good. The analog triggers have less travel, which is fine for me. The two Z buttons have a more tactile and audible click, which also is welcome. They have slightly more travel than the original controller, which may also help with tactile feedback. The shape overall seems pretty much the same, and the rest of the buttons feel the same as well.<br /><br />The gates around the sticks, however, are higher, which to me is a lot better than the original, especially when it comes to games like Smash. What this means is that there's less travel for the sticks, making moves tighter and faster. I'm not sure how this bodes with platformers as I've yet to try that (should get Odyssey shortly), but for games like Smash it works great.<br /><br />The convenience factor alone makes the price tag worth it. Yes, it's more expensive than the original, first-party controller, but you get more colors, Switch-specific buttons, and wireless connectivity.

5.0,First amiibo. Very impressed.,"I stayed away from amiibo for the longest time because I saw them as a waste of money. I mean, sure, some had DLC within, so as physical DLC I thought they were neat, but as collectibles I thought ""Nah.""<br />In all, however, I bought these to unlock the DLC in Breath of the Wild.

3.0,"Great controller, but not without its flaws.","(Update at bottom.)<br /><br />I need to preface this by saying I'm a big fan of 8BitDo. I've pre-ordered almost all of their controllers this year, and am looking out for the Zero 2 and SN30 Pro+. I think they're fast becoming one of the best third-party controller makers out there, second only to Hori.<br />I was a skeptic at first, but ever since one came with my Analogue Nt mini I was a quick fan.<br /><br />I opted for the N64 variant for the N30 pro 2. While the GameCube colors definitely pop more, I prefer a more muted iteration. Plus, there's not as enough N64 love compared to GCN!<br /><br />I also have to say that this is my first 8BitDo controller with analog sticks. As I did not own the previous N30 Pro, I wasn't aware of how small this controller is compared to others. Mind you, it's not a micro controller, but it's definitely about 1/3 or so smaller than controllers like the Wii Classic Controller (Pro). If you came into this knowing this already, then great; but if you're like me and were expecting a standard-size controller, then it's something you'd want to consider. As such, everything is shrunken, from the buttons to the sticks. It's better as a travel controller, but maybe not so for home use.<br />That's one star docked for me, but I realize that's more of a personal preference.<br /><br />I do like that it uses USB-C to charge, and it charged right away. There are two LEDs along the side to indicate battery and pairing status. They're bright, but not glaringly so. I was pleased when I made this discovery when I first plugged it in.<br /><br />Since this is geared toward Switch users, there are Switch buttons at the bottom; I do not own a Switch at the moment. I plan on using this with my Android and PC for now, and then see how it tests with a Switch when I get one.<br />But I do want to point out that, when I plugged in the controller to charge, I accidentally pressed the Switch buttons that are located at the button. They're clicky, but very easy to press, whether intentionally or accidentally.<br /><br />On my Android and PC, I noticed some small lag between inputs. It wasn't bad, but definitely not zero-lag. I'm sure it's just the programs I used that inserted the lag. The buttons are nicely clicky, and 8BitDo has made the best third-party d-pad to date, something which is not very easy to accomplish.<br />While minuscule, the buttons do not feel noticeably small. They're easy to locate and press with tactility, and the analog sticks even have buttons themselves!<br /><br />The second star that I'd like to dock, however, comes from the shoulder buttons. I get what 8BitDo was trying to do here, but the L1 and R1 triggers are a bit difficult for me to press. They're located on the outer part of the top, while L2 and R2 are toward the center. It's like the new 3DS, but the way my index fingers rest on the top here makes it so that I press L2 and R2 instead of L1 and R1, unless I move them to uncomfortable positions. Some people might be able to press the outer shoulder buttons more easily--perhaps with the inside of a knuckle--but my fingers won't let me do so comfortably. With computers, you can easily fix this by swapping them, but you would have to with every program. With consoles, this may not be as easy if they're hard-programmed inputs. I hope 8BitDo offers a firmware version where you can swap these.<br /><br />I am otherwise pleased and do not regret my purchase. You get a nice, universal controller with analog sticks (that have buttons), vibration, and wonderful color schemes. This is more of a travel controller and is at least much better than other travel controllers. I'm not sure whether I want to order a Zero 2 as now I fear that may be too small!<br /><br />(PS, sorry for the rotated picture. It showed up fine on my PC.)<br /><br />***UPDATE 11/30/18***<br /><br />Okay, so after using this a few more days after writnig this review I have to say it's grown on me. I'm bumping it up from 3 to 4 stars because, as a controller for Android or computer systems, it works marvelously. The little sticks are actually very comfortable to use despite being minuscule, and the d-pad still is wonderful, but the shoulder problems still remain an issue for me.

5.0,8BitDo continues to be great.,"I tend to prefer first-party controllers over third-party ones. I also consider myself to prefer original hardware over emulators when it comes to older consoles. That said, I have both of Analogue's Nintendo products and the former came with an 8BitDo controller. ""Neat,"" I thought, ""but I will never use it."" I was wrong.<br /><br />After an update, I found very minimal lag with the N30 controller and the Retro Receiver. Even on my HDTV. For games that required zero-lag precision, I opted for my first-party, wired controllers, but for RPGs and such I default to 8BitDo's controller. It's not the most comfortable because of the square shape of the original NES controller (dogbone controller all the way), but the fact that I can play a near-authentic NES on my HDTV, while sitting comfortably on my couch, is a huge bonus.<br /><br />With the Analogue Super Nt I decided to go with 8BitDo's SNES-styled controller in matching colors. I liked it very much and, again, experienced little lag.<br />When 8BitDo announced this past summer all the controllers they were releasing, I drooled over all the colors and made it a habit of checking Amazon's site for pre-orders. Seeing as I no longer have a functioning NA SNES controller, I decided to go with the good ol' lavender buttons this time around; I miss the concave and convex buttons.<br /><br />8BitDo has been doing a great job of making products in such large masses with quality packaging and materials. The box is a nice matte, sleeved container with just the controller and USB-mini cable within--no more, no less. The controller has a bit of a shine on the face, though, that you can't really tell from the pictures. I like it; it's a bit darker in person and has a sort of glittery effect depending on the angle you hold it.<br /><br />The buttons are great. So far I used it with my Note8 and my SNES's Retro Receiver. I experience very slight lag with the Note8, but no noticeable ones with the RR. One thing to note is that there may be firmware updates for these controllers. I know the N30 needed one to minimize lag, but I haven't checked whether there were any updates for this one.<br /><br />I recall some customers saying they had issues with the d-pad on previous versions of this controller. I haven't had any issues. The sequence of buttons to pair is a bit different on this one than my SN30 Famicom-colored one; I think they made it a bit more complicated, but at least you get a set of instructions in case you forget.<br /><br />The ABXY buttons are a bit clicky on these controllers, which doesn't bother me in the slightest. I actually prefer that over the aged, mushy ones on my older first- and third-party SNES controllers. I haven't touched a new SNES controller since my cousin got an SNES for his birthday when they were new, but I have a new, original NES controller; the buttons are slightly clicky as well.

4.0,Not bad for office listening.,"Using these now as I write this. I've been using this with my Note8 and PowerAmp (latest beta release), and the sound is pretty decent. I have it plugged into my computer as it was the only way to turn on the DAC, then have a line-out cable from the Note8 headphone jack to the DAC, and, finally, the USB cables from the DAC to the headphones. Whew! But they work! As I use these at work, I can't have any music on the work machine; so I have to use my phone, which has most, if not all, my FLAC files. I guess one good thing about having to plug it into the PC is that I can quickly watch a YouTube here or there as the sound from the computer connects to the DAC-headphones.<br /><br />This is the first time I use headphones with no physical adjustment on the actual main band. Rather, there is an elastic band that stretches as you put the headphones over your head and down to cover your ears. Since this is an over-ear headphone, you'll know when it's a good fit when the pads go completely around your ears.<br />Thankfully, you don't really need to download software to control the phones. Even though I use this at work, I tested out all the features by using the GameDAC device alone. I turned off all the lights in the end but did some testing with them and they were nice. I like that they come with RGB lights, which is cool depending on what you're in the mood for.<br /><br />The mic is telescopic, but I haven't used that past the day it was opened. I was able to hear everything in my environment just fine, though. The caps on the headphones are magnetic, so they're removable, and my guess is for swapping them with ones with different designs.<br /><br />Sometimes I feel like the sound isn't at its peak for the price when listening to music. I switch to HDR and regular PC input and I honestly cannot tell much of a difference, even when fiddling with my phone's settings. I know you oughtn't use a phone for music referencing, but my Note8 with PowerAmp and FLAC should power these headphones moderately well, and I feel underwhelmed when using these cans with the GameDAC for listening to music.<br /><br />The construction is fantastic, though. These are some of the most comfortable I've worn in this price range, and the metal hinges feel extremely sturdy. I can wear these all day at work and not get fatigued.<br /><br />The volume wheel on the left is very sensitive, and I'm constantly fiddling with it. Between the volume from my phone, the DAC, and the headphones, there are a lot of volumes to be handled. I wish with my setup there was a way to turn off the volume from the headphones and rely just on the DAC. Also, I'm accidentally pressing the volume on/off button for the mic, but it's easier to tell when it's off as the sides of the button are red and show so when the volume button is depressed.<br /><br />I think for the price point it's fine considering you get a fully fledged gaming set with GameDAC.

3.0,Good for the price; some nitpicks.,"Got this one for work. Eventually I'd like to get a Master, but that will have to be put on the back-burner for now. So far, I've used a basic Logitech mouse, an MX 518, and the Proteus Core in the last ten years. They all were my favorites mouses (yes, you heard me right: &#34;mouses&#34;), and I've been itching to replace the perfectly fine MX 518 I have at work, so I nabbed this one.<br /><br />I think what they're trying to here is merge their lower-end mouses with their higher-end gaming mouses, so that they're able to offer their features to those on a lower budget. So far, I think this is fantastic, but that doesn't mean there aren't issues. It looks, when the lights are off, and feels like a $15 Logitech mouse. Which isn't a bad thing.<br />Every Logitech mouse I've used is far better than most of the alternatives. They make great mouse, and I will continue to source my non-trackball input devices from them in the future.

The click isn't really sensitive as there's not much down stroke, and it's VERY low-profile. I use a fingertip grip and this thing can get a bit uncomfortable for me at times.<br /><br />As for settings, you can use a few of the more basic settings you can from other gaming mouses.

For a work computer, this mouse improves my navigation by a ton, but, like a said, the size does make it a bit uncomfortable for long periods of time.<br /><br />The scroll wheel has no infinite scroll feature, which is the biggest physical downfall I found in terms of physical features. The side buttons are placed better than the MX 518 as I can reach them more easily, and the middle button behind the wheel acts as the tracking speed switcher. The scroll wheel can act as another button upon pressing, if you like, but I have that switched to off as I don't find it necessary for my use.<br /><br />The light does have RGB, but I keep it on a cool blue all the time. You can have it set to either on or off, but I prefer on at a very low setting. I wish it would turn off completely after being idle after a while, but if you leave it on the &#34;on&#34; setting it remains on until the power source (i.e., the computer) is completely off.<br /><br />If you think of it as a budget office mouse with neat little gaming features, then this one will serve handsomely. At $40 retail, however, I think it's priced a little high.

Got this one for work. Eventually I'd like to get a Master, but that will have to be put on the back-burner for now. So far, I've used a basic Logitech mouse, an MX 518, and the Proteus Core in the last ten years. They all were my favorites mouses (yes, you heard me right: &#34;mouses&#34;), and I've been itching to replace the perfectly fine MX 518 I have at work, so I nabbed this one.<br /><br />I think what they're trying to here is merge their lower-end mouses with their higher-end gaming mouses, so that they're able to offer their features to those on a lower budget. So far, I think this is fantastic, but that doesn't mean there aren't issues. It looks, when the lights are off, and feels like a $15 Logitech mouse.

3.0,Biased review on switches.,"Let me start off by saying I am mostly a typist and have not gamed seriously in about a year. I type all day, every day, so the keyboard is an essential part of my quotidian experience. And I am no stranger to mechanical keyboards; I own or have owned almost every type of switch out there: Cherry MX (linear, tactile, clicky), Gateron MX (linear, tactile, clicky), Kailh MX (linear), Topre (55g), buckling spring (Model M), Hi-Tek NMB (clicky), and, of course, good ol' rubber-domes.<br /><br />That said, I missed the full-size layout. Before this keyboard, I had only one in the standard 104-size, but it was hardly used. It was an old keyboard from the early 90s and had a huge bezel. While I'm a huge fan of wider bezels, on a keyboard that's full-size it can be straining to keep your hand on the mouse, especially, if you have a somewhat smaller desk.<br />With this board, however, that bezel is mostly removed. There's not even an inch on any of the sides away from the keys; this is about as compact as you're going to get in a mass-produced keyboard. What makes that better is that your mouse is going to be closer to you. I still prefer TKL keyboards with a separate number pad either to the left of my keyboard or the right of my mouse, but you prefer 104-key keyboards then this one will do just fine without taking up much space.<br /><br />As I mentioned, I'm a typist. I haven't played a game in a couple of months, so this review will be based off the experience of a typist, which I'm assuming almost every gamer does anyway, whether for school, work, or general recreation.<br />The key caps have a texture on them that gripped my fingers as I typed. I can see that these would be good for gaming, but as for general, everyday typing I was not a fan. Thankfully, one of the great things about mechanical keyboards is that you can customize them; so off came the caps. The stabilized caps (space bar, Enter, Shifts, Back Space, and the long number pad keys) were a bit more difficult to take off. The board uses costar stabilizers (or a variant), which means that there is a wire under each cap and loops that insert into the keys to connect to the wire, thereby &#34;stabilizing&#34; them. When pulling off the key caps from these switches, take care not to take them off all the way or else you will rip off the whole wire and, sometimes, the stabilizer clip from the top plate. Not to worry too much, though, as you can pop these back in, similar to older Alps stabilizers.<br /><br />So, once I got these caps removed and placed my own I was ready to type. For a while I hated the kickstands on keyboards; they were always too high for my taste. That said, I cannot use completely flat keyboards anymore after delving into mechanical keyboards, and, thankfully, the legs on this board on that high. So kicked them I did.<br /><br />As for gaming, I do not agree that MX Blue switches, which are tactile and clicky, are ideal. I think Red and Black switches are more desirable, with Red if you need faster presses. Those switches are linear with no bump whatsoever; you simply press them and they slide down. With Blue, you have some resistance about halfway. For typing, they're absolutely fine. The feel is great, but the noise is harsh after a while.<br /><br />The LEDs glow brightly, which I actually like. Usually I'm not a fan of colored LEDs, but something about red makes the glow pleasant in dimmed rooms.<br /><br />I do like that the cable is detachable as well. Makes it that much easier for me to swap out the multiple keyboards I use at a given notice.<br /><br />As for the case, I mentioned it's sleek, but it does give some flex when putting on other caps. When I placed a set I have which is relatively easy to place or remove, I found that the case bent down almost every time.<br /><br />With all that said, I believe you can find better &#34;gaming&#34; boards for your money, with a switch that is designed for gaming. While I believe there's definitely a market for blue clicky switches, and some gaming boards come with other clicky alternatives, a keyboard designed for gaming would be best suited with linear switches; or, in the case of Logitech, even an in-house made switch.",[],B01LWMXIRY,B085QJSSQZ,AEUAL3EJKUSTNB4YY6STLYGTJALA,1479858736000,4,False,"Biased review on switches.

5.0,A great addition to the family.,"For years I have been using the MX 518. It's a fantastic mouse, but there have been many upgrades and additions to mouse technology since then. I've been drooling over other mice, namely from Razer, Zowie, and Logitech; Logitech has the best general mice, though they may not have as many fancy features as others. Still, if you want a sturdy mouse that will last you years, Logitech is the way to go.<br /><br />The G502 combines the best of all mouse worlds for me. It's got a braided cord, combines my favorite colors in their scheme, has a two-way scroll wheel WITH BUTTON, different DPI buttons, forward and backward buttons, and an additional side button. It also has two buttons behind the scroll wheel, but one is dedicated to the wheel mode setting. There's also a longer groove on the side for the thumb to rest, and it's more comfortable than the one on my MX 518. The wheel tilts to allow side scrolling, but it never works for me the way I want it no matter how I change the settings.<br /><br />I had an Anywhere MX mouse and I HATED the wheel. I much preferred the MX 518 scrolling, and still kind of do. The Proteus uses the same wheel type as the Anywhere, but the clicking isn't as forceful; it's still harder than the MX 518, but I've actually gotten quite used to it now.<br /><br />The left mouse button is shorter and higher than the right one, and that's perfect for me as I have a semi-claw grip. The ""G"" icon does indeed have a bright light, but it's never bothered me. Either way, you can change the setting to how long it stays on while idle or to shut off permanently.<br />I'll get to the weights in a bit.<br /><br />But the best feature? For me at least it's the reprogrammable buttons.<br />I've reprogramed the wheel button and the one behind, as well as the additional button in front of the forward button. The forward and backward buttons I've kept the same, and I'm glad to report that they're much better stationed than the one on my MX 518. The MX forward button caused me to slide my hand to reach it, whereas I can easily reach both on the Proteus without removing my hand from the mouse.<br />The lip is very comfortable for my thumb, and provides more of a rest than my previous ""gaming"" mouse.<br /><br />Now for the weights.<br />They come with the mouse in this neat little case. The bottom of the mouse opens extremely easily, but it's sturdy enough so that it won't come undone on its own. There's no tactile or audible click or anything, but you'll tell when the bottom is securely back on. I've used only one weight so far and I'm pretty satisfied with that. I tested it over a week with different weights before deciding on my own preference.<br /><br />Most of the mouse is made of plastic as you'd expect, while the sides have this nice rubber texture for better grip. It's not the sort of rubber that will show dead skin easily, so no worries there. This is my first mouse with a braided cable, and I'm quite pleased with its lightweight maneuverability thus far.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased. It's everything I wanted in a mouse, and a worthy upgrade to my MX 518. I keep the latter at work now.<br /><br />I'm not a gaming expert; I just wanted a comfortable mouse that'll be perfect for all my normal tasks, and will prove competent for my Steam gaming.<br />There are some pretty good wireless mouses out there, but I always tend to stick with corded when possible to decrease computer error.

5.0,A fantastic continuation to the previous game.,"Having played a good amount of Rayman Origins on both the PS3 and its mini counterpart on iOS, I was ecstatic when I heard a sequel was coming out. I played only the original Rayman on the PlayStation way back when, so this revamp of the character was a fresh and colorful experience.

2.0,Bad sound and a hassling set-up make these tight headphones cruddy.,"As you might tell from my review, I'm not wholly pleased with these headphones. When I ordered them, I was initially excited about them. I have some Turtle Beach headphones that are slightly more expensive than these, but they do tend to become slightly uncomfortable after long periods of time.<br /><br />So I ordered these. I was on the boat about the cord, but I actually prefer cords over wireless in such devices so that I don't have to worry about scrambling for batteries or charging it when the battery's low. The length of the cord is good for my living room.<br /><br />When I plugged it into my PS3, having not yet read the instructions, I was surprised that there was no sound coming through. So I perused through the quick setup and was aghast that I, indeed, had to use the included audio jacks. I really really really really really don't like audio jacks. I understand that they might ""improve"" or have a work-around for audio, but the fact that I have to get my jacks out of my PS3 box just to plug `em into the back of the TV for audio (and since my TV has only one set of RCA ports, into which my Atari is plugged), it's really inconvenient and messy when I have to use the ol' red and white audio jacks. Haven't they done a work-around for this? I have HDMI cables, and I love `em. Surely Thrustmaster can do better. My Turtle Beach headphones, while understandably more expensive, connect into the front USB port...and that's it.<br /><br />So when I finally did what Thrustmaster bid, I tried the sound quality, and it didn't negate my already negative feelings toward the headphones. The sound sounds almost tinny, and the headphones and their longest stretch barely fit `round my head, and I don't even have a big head! I usually click two or three times on headphones to make `em fit, but on these Thrustmasters I had to pull `em all the way and even then they fit just so.<br /><br />I tried these on my iPhone, but the jack is a little big to fit with the case on my iPhone, so I took it out and tried the sound. It was rather worse since it was meant to utilize the red and white audio jacks.<br />Disgusting.<br /><br />Overall, I am disappointed. Perhaps I'm spoiled by my Creative and Turtle Beach headphones, but for the price Thrustmaster could do better. Or maybe even lower the price point. My $20 Sennheisers sound better, but I'm a big fan of Sennheiser.

I doubt it's the Tactic Link card in it.<br />I downloaded Creative's updater, and it recognizes the device when it's plugged in, but the update constantly fails.

Or, at least, it won't turn on when connected to either my Mac or Windows computers. It's strange, because my computer will recognize when it's plugged in as any sound will try and shoot to the device, but since the actual Recon3D itself won't light up (ie, turn on), it can't connect to my Omega headphones, thus defeating the purpose.<br />I've emailed Creative to see what the issue could be.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/13/11:<br />I've kept the original review below. It turns out I was missing the card, but Creative was gracious enough to send it to me so I can experience the full sound explosion in its glory. As a company, they rock. Their products are amazing, albeit overpriced.<br /><br />Pairing the Omega headphones with their Recon3D was easy with the TacticLink (though I did have trouble at first), and the sounds is fantastic. I tested Star Wars on Blu-ray, and, sure enough, there was a huge difference from just using the Recon3D with $20 Sennheisers. Not only do the headphones make a difference, but the Recon3D does a magnificent job of imitating true THX sound. Having the Recon3D, it eliminates the cords from the Omega connecting to the TV and PS3. You only need to connect the Recon3D via USB to the PS3 and the optical cable (included) from the PS3 to the TV, and that's it. The Omega headphones sit comfortably on their rest, no other cords, pucks, plugs necessary.<br /><br />It's fantastic for console gaming, but at $300 for both, it's too pricey, considering that you can find some with slightly less sound quality for under $100. While it's multi-platform (though I've only used it with the PS3 and Macbook Pro), the price can detract some, but the sound quality makes it worth it.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Shouldn't it be the opposite? I have Creative's Tactic 3D Omega headphones, and got the Recon 3D to pair with it. It should be easier, shouldn't it?

4.0,Great Controller Grips for Oculus Quest 2,These Chargeable Controller Grips are a great accessory to the Oculus Quest 2.

5.0,Its a remake not a remaster.,"This game is a remake, meaning the defining characteristic of Gears of war 1 had to show and stick around; literally Fps , clunky, and simply slow in comparison to Gears 2/3. This was due to time restrain and the port simply not working as well to Xbox one but the way I see it it was not only an opportunity for Black tusk to experiment as well as measure sales but it simply gave them the opportunity to get used to the essence of what makes a Gears game a Gears game; this is where it all started after all.<br /><br />The graphics and story are revamped give both newcomers a beautiful first time experience and the veterans, like me, the nostalgia we hoped for. The game is absolutely amazing in comparison and for those who don't agree.... They've gotta be blind or relying on memory (try gears 1 for Xbox 360 its like $5) I cant make it past the 1st chapter even if you paid me. I simply don't have enough patience for the outdated mechanics. However I found myself walking though gears UE analyzing the graphics in ever chapter, amazed instead of running through and even attempting to wallbouce since the speed was now fast enough to consider it.  Inn every chapter I noticed the scene was always kept true to gow1 but updated to have more of an effect in rage of emotions due to a now noticeable blood shed, light coming in on a garden, or the characters reacting to someone's death who was before disregarded and unimportant and It hurts ... Haha however the big con I noticed was the AI...they're broken and seem to have been doing drugs since they run into walls, take cover on the wrong walls keeping themselves exposed, and occasionally having a dance off which could cause single players a major issue and I find it unforgivable to have such a massive issue left un-addressed.<br /><br />Multiplayer wise.... It's a brutal as it's ever been and not for everyone. You won't be able to pick it up as easily as a call out duty game or halo. People playing this game are unforgiving and its best to play alongside someone else or a team if youre new lol.<br /><br />People will constantly complain about the gnasher accuracy (as always) , speed, and power weapon rages and I doubt this will ever change but I have to say this is an enjoyable multiplayer in comparison to GOWJ and I would regard it almost as highly as GOW3. There are kinks that need to be worked out but nothing I noticed that couldn't be patched in later and it shouldn't take 1000 patched like with destiny or the, still broken halo mcc; this works. Lol my personal issue with the game is not having surround sound but, correct me if I'm wrong, this seems to be a feature mostly unsupported by Xbox one and not just the game in general.<br /><br />If you buy this and you're new, please, please, please, play the campaign first and get used to the mechanics since multiplayer may turn you off from the game. It's a shark tank but it's the rush you get once you've gotten used to it that will keep some of us up until 7am playing -it may  take some brutal beatings before you begin to enjoy it.

4.0,not too shabby,"First off, I don't know who ever thought that it's so funny you'll be rolling on the floor laughing, but maybe I'm not easily amused enough. It's a fun game, but I wouldn't call it really funny.<br /><br />To me, it's basically a souped-up version of the old Duck Hunt game. Which is basically what I was expecting, so that's ok. I did kind of expect more story to it, but I don't mind that there isn't a bunch of narration. They introduce to you different kinds of rebel chickens--there are the regular ones, then there are more difficult chickens like secret agent chickens and viking chickens and robochickens.<br /><br />The levels are ok. They can be tough when you're playing by yourself, but it hasn't taken my husband long to move through them when you only need at 3 out of 5 stars to proceed to the next level. It only took him 2 or 3 tries each to move on so far and I think he's on level 4 or 5 now.<br /><br />One problem we have with this game: the description says that the game is ""double the craziness in two-player mode"", but it is decidedly not so. The two-player mode doesn't have any added difficultly compared to the one-player mode. Meaning even though you've got two players, they don't add any extra chickens to shoot. A level is exactly the same as it is when only one person is playing. So it's rather easy to move up the levels if you've got two people playing.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty fun game and can be mildly addictive. It's not difficult, but then again I'm the type of person to become frustrated with games and give up on them too quickly when they get too hard.",[],B002HGE308,B002HGE308,AH7P2ZJ7NDT2NNVS7ZEGNEPT2J2Q,1325470978000,1,True,"not too shabby First off, I don't know who ever thought that it's so funny you'll be rolling on the floor laughing, but maybe I'm not easily amused enough.

5.0,Excellent gaming / everyday mouse,"I bought this mouse without reading many of the reviews. I searched for ""silent mouse"" and followed a trail of products until I landed on this Logitech G502 HERO mouse. I don't know if it was advertised as quiet or silent, but it doesn't matter too much at this point. The mouse is very well crafted, and the weights that are provided allow you to customize how heavy the mouse is. I didn't think this would make a big difference, but it truly does. The weight keeps the mouse parallel to the desk surface but doesn't seem to inhibit movement at all. It's a fantastic feeling. Additionally, the mouse is wired, which eliminates having to worry about batteries or latency with a wireless connection.<br />I use this mouse for gaming and for everyday office use, but gamers who are more ""serious"" about their gaming will find all the bells and whistles needed. There are around 10 buttons on this mouse, and the software that is downloaded from the Logitech website makes setting up the functions very easy.<br />I believe this mouse was under $40 or $50 dollars when I bought it, and it is worth every penny in my opinion.<br />(By the way, it is not a quiet or silent mouse, but the clicks don't make much more noise than you'd expect of a high quality mouse.)",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AF477YST23LH5KFYR32ZBIVSBLEA,1675186114873,2,True,"Excellent gaming / everyday mouse I bought this mouse without reading many of the reviews.

1.0,Not for beginners - buy a DVD instead!,"I was disappointed in this product.  First off, if you are a beginner like me, many of the exercises may be too hard for you, and unlike a DVD, they offer no modifications.  It's not low-impact, and starts right off with jumping jacks.  During the setup, you do use the Wii device to input your weight & measurements and choose a goal.  But after that, for the actual training portion, there is really no interaction with the Wii - no reason for it to be a Wii program at all.  In my opinion it is not as good as a regular workout DVD.  It is much easier to pause a DVD, or replay a segment, than it is on the Wii.  And a workout DVD often has 5-6 people, all doing various levels of the same exercises.  There are several different environments you can choose to ""workout"" in, but so what?  Every other workout DVD is set in Hawaii or on a beautiful beach somewhere.
