# CS6386_Final_Project

In this project, we aim to explore data preprocessing techniques for enhancing the performance of a recommendation system called Blair. Specifically, we will experiment with different methods to clean and prepare the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset, for use in Blair. This will involve handling noisy data, identifying and correcting errors, and applying suitable preprocessing methods to ensure data quality.

Course Information: This project is part of the CS6386:Data to Decisions: Principles of Efficient Data Science course, which focuses on real-world applications of data science techniques. This work has been done in collaboration with Andy Li and Peilin Li.
